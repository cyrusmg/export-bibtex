              migraine history, and experienced 3 to 12 migraines per month,
              but had 15 or fewer headache days per month during the 28-day
              baseline period. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to
              placebo or topiramate, 50, 100, or 200 mg/d, titrated by 25 mg/wk
              to the assigned dose or as tolerated in 8 weeks; maintenance
              therapy continued for 18 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The
              primary efficacy assessment was a reduction in mean monthly
              migraine frequency across the 6-month treatment phase. Secondary
              end points were responder rate, time to onset of action, mean
              change in migraine days per month, and mean change in rescue
              medication days per month. RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-seven
              patients were randomized, and 469 composed the intent-to-treat
              population. The mean +/- SD monthly migraine frequency decreased
              significantly for the 100-mg/d group (from 5.4 +/- 2.2 to 3.3 +/-
              2.9; P <.001) and the 200-mg/d group (from 5.6 +/- 2.6 to 3.3 +/-
              2.9; P <.001) vs the placebo group (from 5.6 +/- 2.3 to 4.6 +/-
              3.0); improvements occurred within the first treatment month.
              Significantly more topiramate-treated patients (50 mg/d, 35.9\%
              [P =.04]; 100 mg/d, 54.0\% [P <.001]; and 200 mg/d, 52.3\% [P
              <.001]) exhibited a 50\% or more reduction in monthly migraine
              frequency than placebo-treated patients (22.6\%). Adverse events
              included paresthesia, fatigue, nausea, anorexia, and taste per
              version. CONCLUSION: Topiramate, 100 or 200 mg/d, was effective
              as a preventive therapy for patients with migraine.",

              evaluated and treated in patients with cardiovascular disease,
              but the potential benefits of this are unclear. OBJECTIVE: To
              evaluate the potential benefits of depression screening in
              patients with cardiovascular disease by assessing (1) the
              accuracy of depression screening instruments; (2) the effect of
              depression treatment on depression and cardiac outcomes; and (3)
              the effect of screening on depression and cardiac outcomes in
              patients in cardiovascular care settings. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE,
              PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, ISI, SCOPUS, and Cochrane databases
              from inception to May 1, 2008; manual journal searches; reference
              list reviews; and citation tracking of included articles. STUDY
              SELECTION: We included articles in any language about patients in
              cardiovascular care settings that (1) compared a screening
              instrument to a valid major depressive disorder criterion
              standard; (2) compared depression treatment with placebo or usual
              care in a randomized controlled trial; or (3) assessed the effect
              of screening on depression identification and treatment rates,
              depression, or cardiac outcomes. DATA EXTRACTION: Methodological
              characteristics and outcomes were extracted by 2 investigators.
              RESULTS: We identified 11 studies about screening accuracy, 6
              depression treatment trials, but no studies that evaluated the
              effects of screening on depression or cardiovascular outcomes. In
              studies that tested depression screening instruments using a
              priori-defined cutoff scores, sensitivity ranged from 39\% to
              100\% (median, 84\%) and specificity ranged from 58\% to 94\%
              (median, 79\%). Depression treatment with medication or cognitive
              behavioral therapy resulted in modest reductions in depressive
              symptoms (effect size, 0.20-0.38; r(2), 1\%-4\%). There was no
              evidence that depression treatment improved cardiac outcomes.
              Among patients with depression and history of myocardial
              infarction in the ENRICHD trial, there was no difference in
              event-free survival between participants treated with cognitive
              behavioral therapy supplemented by an antidepressant vs usual
              care (75.5\% vs 74.7\%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Depression
              treatment with medication or cognitive behavioral therapy in
              patients with cardiovascular disease is associated with modest
              improvement in depressive symptoms but no improvement in cardiac
              outcomes. No clinical trials have assessed whether screening for
              depression improves depressive symptoms or cardiac outcomes in

              increasingly stressful for students in higher education, but
              there is limited research about the extent to which those
              attending student counselling services experience difficulties
              relating to academic issues and how effective counselling is for
              them. Aim The study aimed to evaluate the reliable and clinically
              significant change for students with self-reported academic
              issues. Reliable change occurs when a change in the outcome being
              measured is not attributable to error, while clinically
              significant change occurs when a person moves from a clinical
              population to a healthy population after an intervention, in this
              case counselling. Methodology Pre-existing data from 129
              university students who had attended a student counselling
              service were analysed to determine levels of reliable change and
              clinically significant change. These data related to
              psychological status before and after counselling based on
              CORE-OM total scores; self-report of the impact of counselling on
              academic issues; and demographic variables. Findings In total,
              117 (92\%) of students reported experiencing academic issues to
              some extent. Counselling was found to result in reliable change
              for 67\% and clinically significant change for 40\% of those
              students reporting academic issues. Implications The results of
              the study suggest that, even where academic reasons are not the
              primary cause of referral to student counselling services, a
              significant number of students will also experience difficulties
              in these areas. Counselling was, however, shown to result in
              reliable and clinically significant change in a high percentage
              of those experiencing these additional difficulties.",

  abstract = "There is a growing body of theoretical and clinical literature
              highlighting the role of pride in maintaining eating disordered
              behaviours. Despite its clinical importance, there are no
              measures to assess feelings of pride associated with eating
              psychopathology. This study describes the development and
              validation of the Pride in Eating Pathology Scale (PEP-S), a
              self-report questionnaire that examines feelings of pride towards
              eating disordered symptoms (e.g., pride in food restriction,
              thinness and weight loss). Participants were 390 females,
              recruited from university and community populations, whose mean
              age was 26.99 years. Respondents rated pride in eating pathology
              on a 7-point Likert-scale. Principal Component Analysis indicated
              that the 60-item scale comprised a four component structure: (1)
              pride in weight loss, food control and thinness, (2) pride in
              healthy weight and healthy eating, (3) pride in outperforming
              others and social recognition and (4) pride in capturing other
              people's attention due to extreme thinness. These four components
              explained a total of 65.31\% of the variance. The PEP-S
              demonstrated very good internal reliability ($\alpha$ ranging
              from 0.88 to 0.98) and very good test-retest reliability over a
              3-week time-span (r ranging from 0.81 to 0.93). The PEP-S also
              showed excellent convergent and discriminant validity.
              Furthermore, the scale discriminated between women with high and
              low levels of eating psychopathology. The PEP-S is a
              psychometrically robust measure of pride in eating pathology. It
              has the potential to advance theoretical understanding and may
              also be clinically useful. Copyright \copyright{} 2015 John Wiley
              \& Sons, Ltd. KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGE: The PEP-S is a valid,
              reliable, quick and easy to administer self-report questionnaire
              that measures pride related to eating pathology. The PEP-S
              assesses four clinically relevant dimensions: (1) pride in weight
              loss, food control and thinness, (2) pride in healthy weight and
              healthy eating, (3) pride in outperforming others and social
              recognition and (4) pride in capturing other people's attention
              due to extreme thinness. The PEP-S has very good internal and
              test-retest reliability, and very good convergent and
              discriminant validity. The PEP-S distinguishes between women with
              higher and lower levels of eating psychopathology. The PEP-S
              makes an important contribution to understanding pride in eating
              psychopathology, which is essential from both clinical and
              theoretical perspectives.",

  abstract = "Metacognitive theory, amongst other theories, gives an important
              role to beliefs about mental states, including beliefs about
              emotions, in the maintenance of distress. Mentalization theory as
              well as the dialectical behaviour therapy and emotion-focused
              therapy literature specifies particular beliefs thought to be
              related to emotion dysregulation and therefore to a label of
              borderline personality disorder. The current study aimed to
              develop a questionnaire to measure the beliefs about emotions as
              specified by this literature and to test the relationship of this
              new measure to various aspects of emotion regulation in a
              non-clinical sample of 289 participants. A factor analysis
              extracted six factors, which described beliefs about emotions as
              (a) overwhelming and uncontrollable; (b) shameful and irrational;
              (c) invalid and meaningless; (d) useless; (e) damaging; and (f)

              dysregulation of emotion, suggesting that beliefs about emotions
              could be an important metacognitive construct involved in the
              ability to regulate emotions. Beliefs about emotions may be a
              useful direct or indirect target for treatment of difficulties

               in families and is associated with health and safety risks and
               family problems. The present study examined gender- and
               diagnosis-related differences in reports of hoarding symptoms
               among first-degree relatives of people who hoard, and of
               clinical and community samples. METHODS: The present study
               included 443 participants in a study of hoarding behavior: 217
               with hoarding disorder (HD), 96 with obsessive-compulsive
               disorder (OCD), and 130 nonclinical community controls (CC).
               Assessment included a detailed interview of familial patterns of
               hoarding behaviors among parents and siblings and measures of
               hoarding severity. RESULTS: In the combined sample, participants
               reported more hoarding among female (mothers, sisters) than male
               (fathers, brothers) relatives. Significantly more female than
               male participants indicated they had a parent or any
               first-degree relative with hoarding behaviors. However, within
               the HD sample no significant gender effects were found for
               household, safety, and functioning variables, or for hoarding
               symptom severity. In an age- and gender-matched subsample (total
               n = 150), HD participants reported more hallmark hoarding
               symptoms (difficulty discarding and saving/clutter), and
               acquiring among their relatives compared to OCD and CC samples,
               and parents had higher rates than siblings. CONCLUSIONS:
               Hoarding symptoms appear to be common among first-degree
               relatives of people who hoard and are also found among relatives
               of control samples. The predominance of hoarding symptoms among
               female relatives may indicate genetic or modeling transmission
               but this requires further study using large twin samples.
               Clinicians should consider that family members may also have
               significant hoarding symptoms.",

              METHOD: Six hundred sixty-eight patients recruited for the
              Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study (CLPS)
              were reliably assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for
              DSM-IV Axis I Disorders and the Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV

              influences on body image and eating disturbances-the
              Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire (SATAQ).
              METHOD: Two independent samples of college females completed a
              revision and extension of the SATAQ and factor analyses were
              conducted to determine the underlying structure of the revised
              scale. RESULTS: Factor analyses indicated two distinct
              internalization factors: one appeared to reflect a generic media
              influence related to TV, magazines, and movies. A second factor
              clearly reflected internalization of athletic and sports figures.
              Two other factors, reflecting media pressures and media as an
              informational source, also emerged. Another widely used measure
              of thin-ideal internalization, the Ideal Body Internalization
              Scale-Revised (IBIS-R), was included in factor analyses to
              determine its empirical relationship with the revised SATAQ. None
              of the IBIS-R items loaded with any of the internalization items
              or items reflective of media pressures or information. Instead,
              the IBIS-R appeared to tap into an awareness of appearance norms
              dimension. The SATAQ-3 subscales had excellent convergent
              validity with measures of body image and eating disturbance.
              Eating-disturbed and eating-disordered samples had higher scores
              on SATAQ-3 subscales than a control sample. DISCUSSION: The
              SATAQ-3 measures multiple aspects of a societal influence and
              should prove useful for basic risk factor work as well as for
              gauging the efficacy of prevention and treatment programs.",

              viewing a pro-anorexia website. METHOD: Following construction of
              a prototypic pro-anorexia website, 235 female undergraduates were
              randomly assigned to view either the pro-anorexia website or one
              of two comparison websites related to female fashion (using
              average-sized models) or home d{\'e}cor. Post-website affect,
              cognitions, and behavioral expectations were examined along with
              moderator effects. RESULTS: Study participants exposed to the
              pro-anorexia website had greater negative affect, lower social
              self-esteem, and lower appearance self-efficacy post-website than
              those who viewed a comparison website. Additionally, they
              perceived themselves as heavier, reported a greater likelihood of
              exercising and thinking about their weight in the near future,
              and engaged in more image comparison. Minimal support was found
              for moderator effects. CONCLUSION: Results provide an empirical
              basis for concern (expressed by clinicians, researchers, the
              media) that pro-anorexia websites are a troubling new form of
              thin-ideal exposure that warrants further examination.",

              implicated in many other processes, including synaptic plasticity
              and mitosis. This review aims to introduce cytoplasmic

              mediating this process for different mRNAs and in different

              mediating cytoplasmic polyadenylation in the 3' untranslated
              regions of mRNAs, including the CPE, MBE, TCS, eCPE, and C-CPE.
              In addition to describing the role of general polyadenylation
              factors, we discuss the specific RNA binding protein families
              associated with cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements, including
              CPEB (CPEB1, CPEB2, CPEB3, and CPEB4), Pumilio (PUM2), Musashi

  abstract = "Free radicals vary widely in their thermodynamic properties,
              ranging from very oxidizing to very reducing. These thermodynamic
              properties can be used to predict a pecking order, or hierarchy,
              for free radical reactions. Using one-electron reduction
              potentials, the predicted pecking order is in agreement with
              experimentally observed free radical electron (hydrogen atom)
              transfer reactions. These potentials are also in agreement with
              experimental data that suggest that vitamin E, the primary lipid
              soluble small molecule antioxidant, and vitamin C, the terminal
              water soluble small molecule antioxidant, cooperate to protect
              lipids and lipid structures against peroxidation. Although
              vitamin E is located in membranes and vitamin C is located in
              aqueous phases, vitamin C is able to recycle vitamin E; i.e.,
              vitamin C repairs the tocopheroxyl (chromanoxyl) radical of
              vitamin E, thereby permitting vitamin E to function again as a

              consumption was examined by providing subjects diets that
              engendered varied levels of carbohydrate intake. When subjects
              received placebo and had access to a regular diet, they consumed
              3400 kcal day-1 (53\% carbohydrate, 34\% fat, 13\% protein); and
              fluoxetine decreased caloric intake to 2770 Kcal, without

              67\% carbohydrate) under the high-carbohydrate condition when
              subjects received fluoxetine was not different from intake under

               fast developing field. While epidemiological and neurobiological
               studies paint a somber picture of negative outcomes, relatively
               little attention has been devoted to integrating the breadth of
               findings concerning possible cognitive and emotional deficits
               associated with ELS. Emerging findings from longitudinal studies
               examining developmental trajectories of the brain in healthy
               samples may provide a new framework to understand mechanisms
               underlying ELS sequelae. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this review was
               twofold. The first was to summarize findings from longitudinal
               data on normative brain development. The second was to utilize
               this framework of normative brain development to interpret
               changes in developmental trajectories associated with deficits
               in cognitive and affective function following ELS. RESULTS: Five
               principles of normative brain development were identified and
               used to discuss behavioral and neural sequelae of ELS. Early
               adversity was found to be associated with deficits in a range of
               cognitive (cognitive performance, memory, and executive
               functioning) and affective (reward processing, processing of
               social and affective stimuli, and emotion regulation) functions.
               CONCLUSION: Three general conclusions emerge: (1) higher-order,
               complex cognitive and affective functions associated with brain
               regions undergoing protracted postnatal development are
               particularly vulnerable to the deleterious effects of ELS; (2)
               the amygdala is particularly sensitive to early ELS; and (3)
               several deficits, particularly those in the affective domain,
               appear to persist years after ELS has ceased and may increase
               risk for later psychopathology.",

              risk factors of the alleged eating disorder orthorexia nervosa.
              METHODS: We searched Medline and Pubmed using several key terms
              relating to orthorexia nervosa (ON) and checked the reference
              list of the articles that we found. Attention was given to
              methodological problems in these studies, such as the use of
              non-validated assessment instruments, small sample size and
              sample characteristics, which make generalization of the results
              impossible. RESULTS: Eleven studies were found. The average
              prevalence rate for orthorexia was 6.9 \% for the general
              population and 35-57.8 \% for high-risk groups (healthcare
              professionals, artists). Dieticians and other healthcare
              professionals are at high risk of ON. Risk factors include
              obsessive-compulsive features, eating-related disturbances and
              higher socioeconomic status. Relevant clinical experience,
              published literature and research data have increased in the last
              few years. DISCUSSION: The definition and diagnostic criteria of
              ON remain unclear. Further studies are needed to clarify

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The pursuit for healthy food consumption is
              considered a laudable habit. This attitude can turn into
              pathological when cognitions and worries about healthy nutrition
              lead to such an accurate food selection that correct diet becomes
              the most important part of one's own life leading to important
              dietary restrictions, stereotyped eating or impairment in
              important areas of functioning. This behaviour is coined
              orthorexia nervosa (ON) and can share common characteristics with
              anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN). The purpose of
              the present study was to examine the frequency of ON among women
              with eating disorders (EDs) and to evaluate if it changed after
              treating the ED. METHODS: Thirty-two patients with AN or BN were
              evaluated by means of the ORTO-15, the Yale-Brown-Cornell Eating
              Disorder Scale (YBC-EDS) and the Eating Attitude Test (EAT-26)
              before (t0) and 3 years after the treatment of their ED (t1), and
              compared to 32 female healthy controls (HC) matched by gender,
              age, and BMI at t1. RESULTS: A significantly higher percentage of
              patients either at t0 (28 \%) or t1 (58 \%) resulted positive to
              ORTO-15 compared to controls (6 \%). YBC-EDS and EAT-26 scores
              were higher among ED patients than in HC, but they decreased from
              t0 to t1. CONCLUSIONS: Orthorexia nervosa symptoms are highly
              prevalent among patients with AN and BN, and tend to increase
              after treatment. ON seems associated both with the clinical
              improvement of AN and BN and the migration towards less severe
              forms of EDs. It is necessary to clarify if ON residual
              symptomatology can be responsible for a greater number of
              relapses and recurrences of EDs.",

              self-administered, online questionnaire consisting of five
              measures: ORTO-15, the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale

              Scales Questionnaire (RSQ), and Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale
              (RSES). RESULTS: Correlation analysis revealed that higher
              orthorexic tendencies significantly correlated with higher scores
              for perfectionism (self-oriented, others-oriented and socially
              prescribed), appearance orientation, overweight preoccupation,
              self-classified weight, and fearful and dismissing attachment
              styles. Higher orthorexic tendencies also correlated with lower
              scores for body areas satisfaction and a secure attachment style.
              There was no significant correlation between orthorexia nervosa
              and self-esteem. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed
              that overweight preoccupation, appearance orientation and the

              predictors of orthorexia nervosa with a history of an eating

              attachment style. In addition, a history of an eating disorder
              strongly predicts orthorexia nervosa. These findings suggest that

               adults and has previously been shown to have negative effects on
               body image, depression, social comparison, and disordered
               eating. One eating disorder of interest in this context is
               orthorexia nervosa, an obsession with eating healthily. High
               orthorexia nervosa prevalence has been found in populations who
               take an active interest in their health and body and is
               frequently comorbid with anorexia nervosa. Here, we investigate
               links between social media use, in particularly Instagram and
               orthorexia nervosa symptoms. METHODS: We conducted an online
               survey of social media users (N = 680) following health food
               accounts. We assessed their social media use, eating behaviours,
               and orthorexia nervosa symptoms using the ORTO-15 inventory.
               RESULTS: Higher Instagram use was associated with a greater
               tendency towards orthorexia nervosa, with no other social media
               channel having this effect. In exploratory analyses Twitter
               showed a small positive association with orthorexia symptoms.
               BMI and age had no association with orthorexia nervosa. The
               prevalence of orthorexia nervosa among the study population was
               49\%, which is significantly higher than the general population
               (<1\%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the healthy eating
               community on Instagram has a high prevalence of orthorexia
               symptoms, with higher Instagram use being linked to increased
               symptoms. These findings highlight the implications social media

               media 'celebrities' may have over hundreds of thousands of

               principles that included cognitive in addition to behavioral and

               philosophical changes. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)
               is one of a number of new interventions from both behavioral and

               over form, and the construction of flexible and effective
               repertoires, among other features. They build on the first- and

               conditions, characterised by early-onset difficulties in social
               communication and unusually restricted, repetitive behaviour and
               interests. The worldwide population prevalence is about 1\%.
               Autism affects more male than female individuals, and
               comorbidity is common (>70\% have concurrent conditions).
               Individuals with autism have atypical cognitive profiles, such
               as impaired social cognition and social perception, executive
               dysfunction, and atypical perceptual and information processing.
               These profiles are underpinned by atypical neural development at
               the systems level. Genetics has a key role in the aetiology of
               autism, in conjunction with developmentally early environmental
               factors. Large-effect rare mutations and small-effect common
               variants contribute to risk. Assessment needs to be
               multidisciplinary and developmental, and early detection is

               conducted in private-practice psychiatric outpatient clinics.
               Following a 1-week, single-masked, placebo lead-in period,
               patients received bupropion SR for 8 weeks (study 1: 150 or 300

               events, patient discontinuation rates, changes in weight, vital
               signs, and clinical laboratory test results. Across studies, the
               most frequently reported adverse events were headache, dry

              factors of ON - OCD and ON - ED indicated the higher the

              ON-40, 42.7\% and ON-35, 84.4\%. The analysis of various
              variables confirmed a significant dependency of ON from ED, which
              suggests that ON belongs to ED. The diagnostic accuracy in this

               prone to develop orthorexia nervosa than students in other

               physical activity, and frequency of orthorexia nervosa between
               university students enrolled in an exercise science program (n =
               118) or a business program (n = 89). The students completed the
               Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36), the International Physical
               Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), and ORTO-15, which defines
               orthorexia nervosa as a sensitive and obsessive behavior towards
               healthy nutrition. The SF-36 showed that exercise science
               students scored worse than business students regarding bodily
               pain (72.8 vs. 82.5; p = 0.001), but better regarding general
               health (83.1 vs. 77.1; p = 0.006). Of 188 students, 144 (76.6\%)
               had an ORTO-15 score indicating orthorexia nervosa, with a
               higher proportion in exercise science students than in business
               students (84.5\% vs. 65.4\%; p = 0.002). Orthorexia nervosa in
               combination with a high level of physical activity was most

               exercise science students may cause problems in the future,
               since they are expected to coach others in healthy living. Our

              with other mental disorders including depression, suicidal
              behavior, and substance abuse. In an effort to elucidate the
              neurobiological underpinnings of impulsive aggression and to help
              account for its connections with these other disorders, this
              paper reviews relevant biochemical, brain imaging, and genetic
              studies. The review suggests that dysfunctional interactions
              between serotonin and dopamine systems in the prefrontal cortex
              may be an important mechanism underlying the link between
              impulsive aggression and its comorbid disorders. Specifically,
              serotonin hypofunction may represent a biochemical trait that
              predisposes individuals to impulsive aggression, with dopamine
              hyperfunction contributing in an additive fashion to the
              serotonergic deficit. The current paper proposes a modified
              diathesis-stress model of impulsive aggression in which the
              underlying biological diathesis may be deficient serotonergic
              function in the ventral prefrontal cortex. This underlying
              disposition can be manifested behaviorally as impulsive
              aggression towards oneself and others, and as depression under
              precipitating life stressors. Substance abuse associated with
              impulsive aggression is understood in the context of dopamine
              dysregulation resulting from serotonergic deficiency. Also

              with 10 mg/kg fluoxetine for 12-23 days. In the first experiment,
              body weight and vaginal smears were monitored daily. Fluoxetine
              treatment reduced body weight within the first 24 h of treatment.
              Fluoxetine treatment also elongated the estrous cycle, reduced
              blood levels of progesterone, and eliminated lordosis behavior.
              In the second experiment, body weight and food intake were
              examined and a pair-fed group was included to determine if
              fluoxetine-induced anorexia contributed to the disturbance of the
              estrous cycle. In pair-fed rats, effects similar to fluoxetine
              treatment were present. These results lead to the suggestion that
              fluoxetine's anorectic properties could disrupt the female's
              normal endocrine cyclicity and that this disruption could be
              relevant to the reduction in sexual behavior and motivation.
              However, when the duration of fluoxetine treatment was extended
              beyond 16 to 17 days, fluoxetine-treated female rats reinitiated
              vaginal cyclicity and showed evidence of normal sexual
              receptivity. In contrast, the estrous cycles of their pair-fed
              counterparts remained disrupted. Thus, restricted food intake
              appears to contribute to the disruption of the estrous cycle and
              elimination of sexual receptivity during fluoxetine treatment.
              However, compensatory changes in the serotonergic system that are
              associated with chronic fluoxetine administration may contribute
              to the gradual recovery of estrous cyclicity and sexual
              receptivity of the fluoxetine-treated animals.",

              Battery performance, irreversible charge ``loss'', rate
              capability, cyclability, exfoliation of graphite and safety are
              highly dependent on the quality of the SEI. Therefore,
              understanding the actual nature and composition of SEI is of
              prime interest. If the chemistry of the SEI formation and the
              manner in which each component affects battery performance are
              understood, SEI could be tuned to improve battery performance. In
              this paper key points related to the nature, formation, and
              features of the SEI formed on carbon negative electrodes are
              discussed. SEI has been analyzed by various analytical techniques

              tool exists. OBJECTIVE: To assess the validity and reliability of
              the HIS questionnaire. DESIGN: As no similar tool exists, we
              compared the HIS with three tools that reflect its key areas:
              physical impact (Pregnancy Unique Quantification of Emesis--PUQE
              score and markers of severity of HG), psychological impact
              (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score--HADS) and social impact
              (SF12 quality of life score). SETTING: A large regional referral,
              women and children's hospital in the North West of England.
              PARTICIPANTS: The HIS was evaluated on 50 women admitted to
              hospital with HG and 50 women recruited from ante-natal clinic
              without severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and with an
              uncomplicated pregnancy. RESULTS: Good criterion validity was
              demonstrated by strong significant correlations with all three

              impact: accommodation and burden. The current study describes the
              scale's development and preliminary validation. Methods One
              hundred thirty-four adults, identifying as the relative of
              someone with problematic hoarding (n=102) or normative collecting
              behavior (n=32), completed the FISH alongside measures of
              hoarding severity, burden, functional impairment, and quality of
              life (QoL). Exploratory factor analysis (FA) was used to examine
              the scale's factor structure. Internal consistency, known-groups
              and convergent validity were also investigated. Results FA
              supported two factors, accounting for 65.43\% of variance. Of the
              scale items, 16 were determined to load onto these factors. Items
              that did not load were omitted. The revised scale accounted for
              67.41\% of variance and was characterized by good internal

               accommodation is commonly considered as a unidimensional

               aspects of family accommodation and how different facets (i.e.,
               participation, modification, and distress/consequences) may
               impact pediatric OCD. As such, the present study sought to
               examine the extent to which family accommodation, as a whole and
               within subtypes, was related to OCD symptom severity and symptom
               dimensions, youth clinical characteristics (i.e.,
               internalizing/externalizing symptoms, depressive symptoms), and
               family factors (i.e., cohesion and conflict). Family
               accommodation was related to OCD symptom severity and the

               dysfunction and burden on family members. Currently, little is
               known about the effect that family members have on individuals'
               hoarding symptoms and functioning, and vice versa. The present
               study examined the nature and frequency of accommodation in
               hoarding. Fifty-two individuals with self-reported hoarding
               problems and their close significant others (CSOs) completed the
               Family Accommodation Interview for Hoarding (FAI-H), which was
               adapted from a previously validated measure for this study, and
               a series of self-report questionnaires. The FAI-H was found to
               be a reliable and valid measure of accommodation in problem
               hoarding. CSOs who lived with the individual with the hoarding
               problem reported engaging in accommodating behaviors more
               frequently than those who did not live with the individual.
               Accommodation was positively associated with hoarding symptom
               severity, relationship functioning, and CSOs' rejecting
               attitudes toward the individual with hoarding problems, and it
               partially mediated the association between hoarding symptom
               severity and relationship conflict. These results inform our
               understanding of accommodation and interpersonal processes in
               hoarding, and suggest that accommodation may play an important
               role in problem hoarding.",

              connected layers in SNNs using a spike-timing-dependent

              locations of the input space. These locally-connected SNNs
              (LC-SNNs) manifest key topological features of the spatial
              interaction of biological neurons. We explore a biologically
              inspired n-gram classification approach allowing parallel
              processing over various patches of the image space. We report the
              classification accuracy of simple two-layer LC-SNNs on two image
              datasets, which respectively match state-of-art performance and
              are the first results to date. LC-SNNs have the advantage of fast

               obsessive-compulsive symptom (OCS). However, current evidence
               suggests that these two phenotypes may be clinically, and
               perhaps etiologically, distinct. Both hoarding and OCS have a
               genetic etiology, but the degree of unique and shared genetic
               contributions to these phenotypes has not been well studied.
               METHOD: Prevalence rates were assessed for hoarding and OCS in a
               sample of adult twin pairs (n = 7906 twins) and their family
               members from The Netherlands Twin Register (total sample =
               15,914). Using Mplus, genetic analyses using liability threshold
               models were conducted for both phenotypes, for their
               co-morbidity, and for specific hoarding symptoms (cluttering,
               discarding and acquiring). RESULTS: Of the total sample, 6.7\%
               met criteria for clinically significant hoarding; endorsement of
               all three hoarding symptoms was > or = 79\%. Men had slightly
               higher rates than women. Also, 5.7\% met criteria for clinically
               significant OCS; rates were similar in males and females.
               Genetic factors accounted for 36\% of the variance for hoarding
               and 40\% of the variance for OCS. The genetic correlation
               between hoarding and OCS was 0.10. There was no evidence of
               sex-specific genetic contributions for hoarding or OCS. There
               was evidence for a genetic contribution to all hoarding symptom
               subtypes. Only cluttering showed evidence of a contribution from
               the shared environment. CONCLUSIONS: OCS and hoarding are common
               in this population-based sample, have prevalence rates similar
               to those previously reported, and show significant heritability.
               Genetic factors contributed to the co-morbidity of both traits,

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Sometimes the suspicion is put forward that nutrition
              students show more disordered eating patterns, which may be among
              the motivating factors to study nutrition. At the same time, it
              is not clear whether the students' increasing knowledge about
              diet and nutrition is associated with a more healthy eating
              behaviour or with an unhealthy obsession with food choices.
              DESIGN: Cross-sectional comparison of nutrition students from
              German universities during the first year of their studies (n
              123) and during higher semesters (n 96), with a control group
              from other study programmes (n 68 and n 46, respectively).
              Dietary restraint, disinhibition, the tendency towards orthorexia
              nervosa and healthy food choices were assessed using a
              questionnaire. RESULTS: Nutrition students showed higher levels
              of dietary restraint than the control group. Disinhibition and
              orthorexia nervosa did not differ between nutrition students and
              controls. Orthorexic tendencies were lower in the more advanced
              nutrition students. Healthy food choices did not differ among
              students in the first year. More advanced nutrition students
              showed healthier food choices, whereas the corresponding controls
              showed slightly more unhealthy food choices. CONCLUSIONS:
              Nutrition students, more than other students, tend to restrict
              their food intake in order to control their weight, but they do
              not have more disturbed or disordered eating patterns than other

              4 U.S. and 3 international female samples, as well as a U.S. male

              859) indicated a 22-item scale with 5 factors: Internalization:

  abstract  = "RNA has a dual role as an informational molecule and a direct
               effector of biological tasks. The latter function is enabled by
               RNA's ability to adopt complex secondary and tertiary folds and
               thus has motivated extensive computational and experimental
               efforts for determining RNA structures. Existing approaches for
               evaluating RNA structure have been largely limited to in vitro
               systems, yet the thermodynamic forces which drive RNA folding in
               vitro may not be sufficient to predict stable RNA structures in
               vivo. Indeed, the presence of RNA-binding proteins and
               ATP-dependent helicases can influence which structures are
               present inside cells. Here we present an approach for globally
               monitoring RNA structure in native conditions in vivo with
               single-nucleotide precision. This method is based on in vivo
               modification with dimethyl sulphate (DMS), which reacts with
               unpaired adenine and cytosine residues, followed by deep
               sequencing to monitor modifications. Our data from yeast and
               mammalian cells are in excellent agreement with known messenger
               RNA structures and with the high-resolution crystal structure of
               the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosome. Comparison between in
               vivo and in vitro data reveals that in rapidly dividing cells
               there are vastly fewer structured mRNA regions in vivo than in
               vitro. Even thermostable RNA structures are often denatured in
               cells, highlighting the importance of cellular processes in
               regulating RNA structure. Indeed, analysis of mRNA structure
               under ATP-depleted conditions in yeast shows that
               energy-dependent processes strongly contribute to the
               predominantly unfolded state of mRNAs inside cells. Our studies
               broadly enable the functional analysis of physiological RNA
               structures and reveal that, in contrast to the Anfinsen view of
               protein folding whereby the structure formed is the most
               thermodynamically favourable, thermodynamics have an incomplete
               role in determining mRNA structure in vivo.",

              notoriously difficult. Traditional drug development fails to
              exploit knowledge of the psychological factors that crucially
              influence appetite, concentrating instead on restrictive criteria
              of intake and weight reduction, allied to a mechanistic view of
              energy regulation. Drugs are under development that may produce
              beneficial changes in appetite expression in the obese. These
              currently include glucagon-like peptide-1 analogs such as
              liraglutide, an amylin analog davalintide, the 5-HT(2C) receptor
              agonist lorcaserin, the monoamine re-uptake inhibitor

              pramlintide and metreleptin, bupropion and naltrexone,
              phentermine and topiramate, and bupropion and zonisamide.
              However, the effects of these treatments on eating behavior
              remain poorly characterized. Obesity is typically a consequence
              of overconsumption driven by an individual's natural sensitivity
              to food stimuli and the pleasure derived from eating.
              Intuitively, these processes should be effective targets for
              pharmacotherapy, and behavioral analysis can identify drugs that
              selectively affect desire to eat, enjoyment of eating, satiation
              or postmeal satiety. Rational interventions designed specifically
              to modulate these processes could limit the normally aversive
              consequences of caloric restriction and maximize an individual's
              capacity to successfully gain control over their appetite.",

              involvement of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and orexins in the

              orexin immunostaining in several hypothalamic regions. RESEARCH
              METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Male obese Zucker (fa/fa) rats were
              administered fluoxetine (10 mg/kg intraperitoneally) daily for 2
              weeks. The control group was administered 0.9\% NaCl solution.
              Carcass composition was assessed using the official methods of
              the Association of Official Analytical Chemists. To test the
              potential thermogenic effect of fluoxetine administration, total
              body oxygen consumption was measured daily for 60 minutes before
              fluoxetine or saline injection and for 30 minutes after drug or
              saline injection. Hypothalamic arcuate and paraventricular
              nuclei, and the lateral hypothalamic area were immunostained for
              NPY, orexin A, and orexin B. Commercial kits were used for serum
              determinations. RESULTS: Chronic fluoxetine administration in
              obese Zucker rats generated a reduction in body weight gain, food
              intake, adipocyte size, fat mass, and body protein. A decrease in
              NPY immunostaining in the paraventricular nucleus, without
              changes in the arcuate, was observed. However, no changes were
              observed in the number of neural cells immunostained for orexin A
              or orexin B in the lateral hypothalamic area. DISCUSSION: Due to
              the hyperphagic effect of NPY in the paraventricular nucleus,
              these results suggest that NPY, but not orexins, could be
              involved in the anorexigenic effect of fluoxetine in obese Zucker

              non-pharmaceutical interventions have suppressed the local

              reconstruct the full-spectrum dynamics of COVID-19 in Wuhan
              between 1 January and 8 March 2020 across 5 periods defined by
              events and interventions, on the basis of 32,583
              laboratory-confirmed cases1. Accounting for presymptomatic
              infectiousness2, time-varying ascertainment rates, transmission
              rates and population movements3, we identify two key features of
              the outbreak: high covertness and high transmissibility. We
              estimate 87\% (lower bound, 53\%) of the infections before 8
              March 2020 were unascertained (potentially including asymptomatic
              and mildly symptomatic individuals); and a basic reproduction
              number (R0) of 3.54 (95\% credible interval 3.40-3.67) in the
              early outbreak, much higher than that of severe acute respiratory
              syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)4,5.
              We observe that multipronged interventions had considerable
              positive effects on controlling the outbreak, decreasing the
              reproduction number to 0.28 (95\% credible interval 0.23-0.33)
              and-by projection-reducing the total infections in Wuhan by
              96.0\% as of 8 March 2020. We also explore the probability of
              resurgence following the lifting of all interventions after 14
              consecutive days of no ascertained infections; we estimate this
              probability at 0.32 and 0.06 on the basis of models with 87\% and
              53\% unascertained cases, respectively-highlighting the risk
              posed by substantial covert infections under changing control
              measures. These results have important implications when
              considering strategies of continuing surveillance and

               about their relative or combined efficacy. METHODS: In this
               randomized, controlled trial, we assigned 488 children between
               the ages of 7 and 17 years who had a primary diagnosis of
               separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or
               social phobia to receive 14 sessions of cognitive behavioral
               therapy, sertraline (at a dose of up to 200 mg per day), a
               combination of sertraline and cognitive behavioral therapy, or a
               placebo drug for 12 weeks in a 2:2:2:1 ratio. We administered
               categorical and dimensional ratings of anxiety severity and
               impairment at baseline and at weeks 4, 8, and 12. RESULTS: The
               percentages of children who were rated as very much or much
               improved on the Clinician Global Impression-Improvement scale
               were 80.7\% for combination therapy (P<0.001), 59.7\% for
               cognitive behavioral therapy (P<0.001), and 54.9\% for
               sertraline (P<0.001); all therapies were superior to placebo
               (23.7\%). Combination therapy was superior to both monotherapies
               (P<0.001). Results on the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale
               documented a similar magnitude and pattern of response;
               combination therapy had a greater response than cognitive
               behavioral therapy, which was equivalent to sertraline, and all
               therapies were superior to placebo. Adverse events, including
               suicidal and homicidal ideation, were no more frequent in the
               sertraline group than in the placebo group. No child attempted
               suicide. There was less insomnia, fatigue, sedation, and
               restlessness associated with cognitive behavioral therapy than
               with sertraline. CONCLUSIONS: Both cognitive behavioral therapy
               and sertraline reduced the severity of anxiety in children with
               anxiety disorders; a combination of the two therapies had a
               superior response rate. (ClinicalTrials.gov number,

              provide new interpretations extending beyond those presented in

              translations and synthesis regarding Indigenous understandings of

  abstract  = "Over the last two decades we have witnessed an emerging set of
               conditions in schools which render them contexts replete with
               social messages about the body, health, and self. Research has
               suggested that both the formal and informal contexts of
               education are heavily imbued with a ?culture of healthism? which
               places moral obligation and blame on individuals for their
               health/problem. In this paper we explore the ways in which young
               women with eating disorders constructed their identities within
               and against the various ?health? discourses now found within
               schools. Data is presented from life history interviews with

               been diagnosed with anorexia or bulimia and perhaps others who

               suggested treatments of ON. Method/Design: A literature search

               confusion about use of assessment tools existed, and the lack of
               evidence based treatments for ON was pronounced. Conclusion:
               More research is needed to determine the prevalence of
               pathologically unhealthy, obsessive, ?self-defined healthy,?
               eating behaviors, and to determine if ON is a unique eating

              (1902--1987) was designed to promote openness, growth and change

              which is practical and helpful in education, because it can solve
              some of the problems outside the curriculum faced by students.
              For example it provides a way of understanding and solving issues
              of relationships, emotional development and ethical behaviour
              that seem to be at the root of most of the problems in school and
              society at large. However, it is essential to incorporate some
              accelerating ingredients to inform conditions which facilitate
              growth. These include acceptance, empathy and positive regard
              from others. For example it has been realized that if an
              individual is denied acceptance and positive regard they fail to
              relate the meaning of their experience to themselves and positive
              growth in such a relevant way is inhibited. However, the approach
              is faced with some drawbacks which will be explored. Teaching

               activity exist among young people, in this study termed ?fitness
               hype?. Viewing the body and health as commodities can be
               understood as part of a healthism discourse. In this study, we
               explored how Swedish high school students perceive and negotiate
               the trend regarding exercise, diet and body ideals.
               Semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten high school
               students, aged 16?18 years, from various educational programs
               and with varying levels of physical activity. Using qualitative
               content analysis, we developd one overarching theme navigating
               life satisfaction in the face of an ?unhealthy fitness hype?.
               Four additional, interrelated categories showed how the young
               people negotiated this developing trend through: (1) the quest
               for social recognition and value, (2) social media sets the
               standards, (3) the paradox of strong and skinny as the new
               standard, and (4) the need for new safety nets. Our results
               highlight the young people?s perceptions of an excessive and
               influential focus on health and exercise in contemporary
               society. They described a fitness hype as exorbitant and
               unhealthy ideals of body and exercise, and understood this as
               problematic. Social media was seen as contributing to this hype
               as a powerful arena for ?the quest for social recognition and
               value?. While not all the young people felt negatively affected
               by the fitness hype, they perceived its influence on their
               lives. Further, body and fitness ideals were gendered. Teenage
               girls faced the paradox of shaping themselves as ?strong and
               skinny?. Social ties were recognized as an important safety net,
               particularly classmates, sports mates, and coaches. Knowledge of
               these problems from the perspective of young people is crucially
               needed among health professionals and educators. Further
               research should explore additional support strategies, and young
               people?s experiences of fitness hype among additional youth

              discourses of difference in which Swiss culture is centred and
              foreign ones are marginalised. At present, Eastern and South-East
              European cultures are particularly affected. In this article, we
              challenge perceived cultural incommensurability by examining the
              socialisation of second-generation girls of immigrant background,
              through data generated from semi-structured interviews with them.
              The girls draw on a tightly defined discursive range of
              linguistic resources to construct the meanings of sport, health
              and the body. Specifically, the girls refer to healthism, within
              which sport is seen to provide a means to achieve good health and
              a slim and feminine body. These references reflect a set of
              knowledge and discourses important to Western cultures.
              Alternative discursive resources exist, yet were not utilised. We
              argue that the girls' adoption of healthist ideas is used to
              counter cultural narratives---such as the uncultured, and thus
              non-integrated, immigrant---and that this adoption supports and

              witnessing our clients' hopelessness and experiencing our own can

              recognized in psychotherapy research, yet research exploring

              for doing depth psychotherapy with transgender individuals.
              Combining contemporary psychodynamic, Jungian and gender identity
              theory, this approach reflects the unique path of transgender
              identity development. Transgender identity is not viewed as
              inherently pathological. Rather, the issues that emerge in
              psychotherapy with transgender clients, like with all people, are
              about the self and self-in-relation, negotiating identity with
              outer reality. For the transgender person, however, psychological
              issues are particularly related to faulty mirroring during
              periods of identity construction because the transgender self is
              often invisible to the outside world. Transgender identity
              development involves a body/mind mismatch and is affected by
              social stigma associated with gender variance. Transgender
              individuals negotiate their transgendered self in a world that
              sees gender as binary, resulting in a tension between desire,
              authenticity and avoidance of stigma. A composite trajectory of

  abstract = "Survey research is sometimes regarded as an easy research
              approach. However, as with any other research approach and
              method, it is easy to conduct a survey of poor quality rather
              than one of high quality and real value. This paper provides a
              checklist of good practice in the conduct and reporting of survey
              research. Its purpose is to assist the novice researcher to
              produce survey work to a high standard, meaning a standard at
              which the results will be regarded as credible. The paper first
              provides an overview of the approach and then guides the reader
              step-by-step through the processes of data collection, data
              analysis, and reporting. It is not intended to provide a manual
              of how to conduct a survey, but rather to identify common
              pitfalls and oversights to be avoided by researchers if their
              work is to be valid and credible.",

  author   = "Shelton, Nicola J",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The role that healthy eating plays in good health is
              well documented. Government policy in Scotland recommends
              reducing salt, refined sugar and saturated fat in the diet and
              increasing the consumption of fruit and vegetables,
              carbohydrates, fibre and oily fish. METHODS: Using data from the
              1998 Scottish Health Survey a composite measure of healthy eating
              behaviour was derived by scoring low levels of consumption of
              salt, refined sugar and saturated fat and higher consumption of
              fruit and vegetables, carbohydrates, fibre and oily fish. This
              paper presents results from logistic regression analysis of the
              risk factors for this measure of healthy eating behaviour.
              RESULTS: Young people, men, those on low income, those without
              qualifications, those who take little exercise, who lack access
              to car, live in deprived areas and women who smoke were less
              likely to show healthy eating behaviour. CONCLUSION: Healthy
              eating reflects dietary policy and guidelines for those with
              higher socio-economic status and who demonstrate other health
              seeking behaviour. Health education policy needs to be targeted
              at young people, men, and those of lower socio-economic status,

              Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) Mentoring Program
              has met its goals of fostering academic and personal growth in
              young acute care surgeons. METHODS: We conducted a systematic
              program evaluation of EAST Mentoring Program's first 4 years.
              Demographic information was collected from EAST records,
              mentorship program applications, and mentee-mentor career
              development plans. We reviewed the career development plans for
              thematic commonalities and results of a structured, online
              questionnaire distributed since program inception. A mixed
              methods approach was used to better understand the program goals
              from both mentee and mentor perspectives, as well as attitudes
              and barriers regarding the perceived success of this career
              development program. RESULTS: During 2012 to 2015, 65 mentoring
              dyads were paired and 60 completed the program. Of 184 surveys
              distributed, 108 were returned (57\% response rate). Respondents
              were evenly distributed between mentees and mentors (53 vs. 55, p
              = 0.768). In participant surveys, mentoring relationships were
              viewed to focus on research (45\%), ``sticky situations'' (e.g.,
              communication, work-life balance) (27\%), education (18\%), or
              administrative issues (10\%). Mentees were more focused on
              research and education versus mentors (74\% vs. 50\%; p = 0.040).
              Mentees felt that goals were ``always'' or ``usually'' met versus
              mentors (89\% vs. 77\%; p = 0.096). Two barriers to successful
              mentorship included time and communication, with most pairs
              communicating by email. Most respondents (91\%) planned to
              continue the relationship beyond the EAST Mentoring Program and
              recommended the experience to colleagues. CONCLUSION: Mentee
              satisfaction with the EAST Mentoring Program was high. Mentoring
              is a beneficial tool to promote success among EAST's young
              members, but differences exist between mentee and mentor
              perceptions. Revising communication expectations and time

              requirements for the Business Support System (BSS) in
              telecommunications networks. It is crucial and essential for
              service providers to maintain good operating state of the BSS. In
              this paper, we aim at system error prediction for a BSS, i.e., we
              predict occurrences of the abnormal state or behavior of the BSS.
              Because the occurrences of system errors are rare events in the
              BSS (i.e., the dataset of system status is highly imbalanced), it
              is highly challenging to use machine learning or deep learning
              algorithms to predict system error for the BSS. To address this
              challenge, we propose a machine learning based framework for the
              system error prediction and a Frequency-based Feature Creation
              (FFC) algorithm to create new features to improve prediction. By
              adding the time-series information created by the existing
              features, the proposed FFC can amplify the effects of important
              features. Our experimental results show that the FFC

               of hope in healthcare. Three ways in which persons with hope can
               be vulnerable are illustrated, and the challenge of how

              dieting and restrictive eating, abnormal eating behavior, and
              finally clinical eating disorders. The prevalence of eating
              disorders is increased in elite athletes and for this group the
              cause of starting to diet is related to (a) perception of the
              paradigm of appearance in the specific sport, (b) perceived
              performance improvements, and (c) sociocultural pressures for
              thinness or an ``ideal'' body. Athletes most at risk for
              disordered eating are those involved in sports emphasizing a thin
              body size/shape, a high power-to-weight ratio, and/or sports
              utilizing weight categories, such as in some high-intensity

              sport-specific training, overtraining, injuries, and unfortunate
              coaching behavior, are important risk factors. To prevent
              disordered eating and eating disorders, the athletes have to
              practice healthy eating, and the medical staff of teams and
              parents must be able to recognize symptoms indicating risk for
              eating disorders. Coaches and leaders must accept that disordered
              eating can be a problem in the athletic community and that

              Participants also rated policies according to their feasibility
              and potential for positive impact. RESULTS: Forty-eight percent
              of participants observed weight-related bullying in their school
              and 99\% expressed the importance of intervening in such
              incidents. A large majority (75\%-94\%) supported 8 of the 11
              policies, especially actions requiring school-based health
              curriculum to include content on eating disorder prevention
              (94\%), and addressing weight-bullying through antibullying
              policies (92\%), staff training (89\%), and school curriculum
              (89\%). Strongly supported policies were viewed by participants
              as being the most impactful and feasible to implement.
              CONCLUSIONS: Educators recognize weight-related bullying and
              eating disorders as problems in their schools that warrant
              improved prevention and intervention efforts at the policy level.",

              behaviors have been identified as family accommodation (FA), a
              phenomenon that, if ignored, may facilitate OCD symptoms and lead
              to poorer prognosis. Because FA has been recognized as a
              predictor of treatment outcome, we examined the prevalence of FA
              and identified patient and family sociodemographic and clinical
              variables associated with FA in an outpatient sample. METHODS:
              The study comprised 228 subjects, namely, 114 patients with OCD
              and 114 family members, assessed before the patients entered a
              12-session cognitive behavioral group therapy program. A
              multivariate linear regression model was used to control for
              confounding factors and to evaluate variables independently
              associated with FA. FA was evaluated using the Family
              Accommodation Scale for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder-Interviewer
              Rated. RESULTS: FA was found to be highly prevalent among family
              members. Two patient factors positively associated with FA were

              and higher scores on the Obsessions dimension of the

              Past research has shown that hope and optimism are negatively

              explore the unique factors that account for its positive impact

              the regulation of emotions. We argue that mindfulness has

              of mindfulness to emotional regulation. We consider the unique
              factors that mindfulness meditation brings to the process of
              emotion regulation that may account for its effectiveness. We

              psychotherapeutic interventions require culturally competent
              delivery for ethnoracial minority clients to protect the
              distinctive cultural orientations of these clients. Dominant
              disciplinary conceptualizations of cultural competence are ``kind
              of person'' models that emphasize specialized awareness,
              knowledge, and skills on the part of the practitioner. Even
              within psychology, this approach to cultural competence is
              controversial owing to professional misgivings concerning its
              culturally essentialist assumptions. Unfortunately, alternative
              ``process-oriented'' models of cultural competence emphasize such
              generic aspects of therapeutic interaction that they remain in
              danger of losing sight of culture altogether. Thus, for cultural
              competence to persist as a meaningful construct, an alternative
              approach that avoids both essentialism and generalism must be
              recovered. One means to capture this alternative is to shift
              focus away from culturally competent therapists toward culturally
              commensurate therapies. Indigenous communities in North America
              represent interesting sites for exploring this shift, owing to
              widespread political commitments to Aboriginal cultural
              reclamation in the context of postcoloniality. Two examples from

              commensurability that ranges from global psychotherapeutic
              approaches at one end to local healing traditions at the other.
              Location of culturally integrative efforts by indigenous

              individuals modify their emotional experiences, expressions, and
              physiology and the situations eliciting such emotions in order to
              produce appropriate responses to the ever-changing demands posed
              by the environment. Thus, context plays a central role in emotion
              regulation. This is particularly relevant to the work on emotion
              regulation in psychopathology, because psychological disorders
              are characterized by rigid responses to the environment. However,
              this recognition of the importance of context has appeared
              primarily in the theoretical realm, with the empirical work

              components that characterize emotion regulation and then

              components and their underlying dimensions. Initial guidelines

              and their offspring. Micronutrient supplements are recommended
              for pregnant women because of their documented protective effects
              for the offspring, but their potential beneficial effects on
              maternal mental health are unknown. This study investigated the
              association between prenatal micronutrient supplementation and
              the risk for symptoms of postpartum depression in a longitudinal
              pregnancy cohort from the Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and
              Nutrition (APrON) study. METHODS: Participants came from a cohort
              of the first 600 APrON women. Supplemental nutrient intake and
              symptoms of depression (measured with the Edinburgh Postnatal
              Depression Scale (EPDS)) were collected at each trimester and 12
              weeks postpartum. RESULTS: Of the 475 participants who completed
              the EPDS at least twice in pregnancy and at 12 weeks postpartum,
              416 (88\%) scored <10 and 59 (12\%) scored $\geq$10, where an
              EPDS $\geq$10 is considered to be ``at least probable minor
              depression''. Mean nutrient intakes from supplements were higher
              in women with lower EPDS scores, particularly selenium (p =
              0.0015) and omega-3s (p = 0.01). Bivariate analyses showed that
              several demographic and social/lifestyle variables were
              associated with EPDS $\geq$10: not having been born in Canada (p
              = 0.01), greater number of chronic conditions (p = 0.05), greater
              number of stressful life events during this pregnancy (p = 0.02),
              and lower prenatal and postnatal support (p = 0.0043 and p =
              0.0001, respectively). Adjusting for covariates and nutrients
              known to be associated with postpartum depression, logistic
              regression showed that having a prenatal EPDS $\geq$ 10 increased
              the odds of postpartum depressive symptoms (second and third
              trimester OR = 3.29, 95\% CI = 1.55 - 7.01, p = 0.004 and OR =
              4.26, 95\% CI = 2.05 - 8.85, p < 0.0001, respectively), while
              prenatal supplemental selenium (per 10 mcg, OR = 0.76, 95\% CI =
              0.74 - 0.78, p = 0.0019) and postnatal social support (OR = 0.87,
              95\% CI = 0.78 - 0.97, p = 0.0015) were protective. CONCLUSIONS:
              Multiple factors, including supplementary selenium intake, are
              associated with the risk of postpartum depressive symptoms.
              Future research on dietary supplementation in pregnancy with
              special attention to selenium intake is warranted.",

              measurement has traditionally focused on symptom reduction rather
              than functioning or quality of life (QoL). Generic QoL measures
              lack sensitivity for some diagnoses and many not be responsive in
              eating disorder patients. This article describes the development
              and validation of a condition-specific QoL measure for
              adolescents and adults with eating disorders--the Eating
              Disorders Quality of Life Scale (EDQLS). METHODS: Multi-source
              and multi-stage methods were used to develop the EDQLS, with
              participation of patients with EDs, their family members and ED
              treatment providers. Sources for domain and item development
              included 39 articles, 12 patient and 10 treatment provider
              interviews, and 31 first person narratives from the internet.
              Four stages of validation and pre-testing involving 17 patients,
              10 family members and 18 providers reduced 233 items to 40 items
              in 12 domains. These items were pilot tested in 41 ED patients.
              RESULTS: The final instrument was then validated in a 12 site
              sample of 171 individuals aged 14-60 with EDs. All items showed
              good dispersion. The total raw mean score was 110 out of 200 (SD
              27.6) with higher scores indicating better QoL. Internal
              consistency was excellent (Cronbach's alpha = .96) and subscale
              internal consistency ranged from alpha .36 to .79 providing
              evidence for a strong overall construct and some
              multi-dimensionality. Validity was supported by significant
              differences in mean EDQLS according to severity levels on the
              EDI-2 (F = 95.3, p <.001) and the BSI (F = 86.9, p <.001). EDQLS
              scores were positively associated with time in treatment (F =
              4.65, p = .01) suggesting responsiveness. A strong positive
              association was also found between EDQLS scores and stage of
              change (F = 15.1 p <.001). Pearson's correlations between the
              EDQLS and criterion instrument scores were .71 for the SF-12
              mental subscale, .61 for the QoLI and .78 for the 16D, supporting
              construct validity. Exploratory principal components and item
              response theory analyses identified only a few poor fitting
              items. CONCLUSION: The EDQLS has promising psychometric

              years; range 14-60) in 12 treatment programs in four Canadian
              provinces. Total score differences across the time points and
              responsiveness were examined using both anchor- and
              distribution-based methods. RESULTS: 98 (75\%) and 85 (65\%)
              responses were received at 3 and 6 months respectively. No
              statistically significant differences were found between the

              characteristic. Mean EDQLS total scores increased from 110 (SD =

              and the difference by time was tested using a general linear
              model (GLM) to account for repeated measurement (p < .001).
              Responsiveness was good overall (Cohen's d = .61 and .80), and
              confirmed using anchor methods across 5 levels of self-reported
              improvement in health status (p < .001). Effect sizes across time
              were moderate or large for for all age groups. Internal
              consistency (Chronbach's alpha=.96) held across measurement
              points and patterns of responsiveness held across subscales.
              EDQLS responsiveness exceeded that of the Quality of Life
              Inventory, the Short Form-12 (mental and physical subscales) and
              was similar to the 16-dimension quality of life scale.
              CONCLUSIONS: The EDQLS is responsive to change in geographically
              diverse and clinically heterogeneous programs over a relatively
              short time period in adolescents and adults. It shows promise as

              small proportion of Aboriginal youth have contact with mental

              or Torres Strait Islander adolescent who is experiencing a mental

              Australian Aboriginal people who are experts in Aboriginal youth
              mental health, participated in a Delphi study investigating how
              members of the public can be culturally appropriate when helping
              an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander adolescent with mental
              health problems. The panel varied in size across the three
              sequential rounds, from 37-41 participants. Panellists were
              presented with statements about cultural considerations and
              communication strategies via online questionnaires and were
              encouraged to suggest additional content. All statements endorsed

              RESULTS: From a total of 304 statements shown to the panel of

              is only a fine line between purely functional behaviour and
              clinically relevant eating disorders. Especially the rapid form
              of weight manipulation seems to foster later eating disorders. So
              far, most studies have focussed on adult athletes and
              concentrated on manifest eating disorders. In contrast, our
              review concentrates on young athletes and weight-control
              behaviour as a risk factor for eating disorders. An electronic
              search according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for
              Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) Statement was performed
              using Pubmed, PsychInfo and Spolit. The following search terms
              were used: weight-control, weight-control behaviour, weight gain,
              weight loss, pathogenic weight-control behaviour and
              weight-concerns, each of them combined with elite athlete, young
              elite athlete, adolescent elite athlete and elite sports.
              Overall, data are inconsistent. In general, athletes do not seem
              to be at a higher risk for pathogenic weight concerns and
              weight-control behaviour. It does seem to be more prevalent in
              leanness sports, though. There is evidence for pathogenic
              weight-control behaviour in both genders; male athletes mostly
              trying to gain weight whereas females emphasise weight reduction.
              There is not enough data to make predictions about connections
              with age of onset. Young elite athletes do show weight-control
              behaviour with varying degrees of frequency and severity. In
              particular, leanness sports seem to be a risk factor for weight

              platform readily identifies affected individuals. The aim of this
              study was to evaluate epigenetic profiles as biomarkers for
              spastic CP. A novel analysis pipeline was employed to assess DNA
              methylation patterns between peripheral blood cells of adolescent
              subjects (14.9 $\pm$ 0.3 years old) with spastic CP and controls
              at single CpG site resolution. RESULTS: Significantly hypo- and
              hyper-methylated CpG sites associated with spastic CP were
              identified. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling fully
              discriminated the CP group from the controls. Machine learning
              based classification modeling indicated a high potential for a
              diagnostic model, and 252 sets of 40 or fewer CpG sites achieved
              near-perfect accuracy within our adolescent cohorts. A pilot test

              cells. A clinical diagnostic test utilizing a panel of CpG sites

  author   = "Cohen, Rachel and Blaszczynski, Alex",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Appearance comparison has consistently been shown to
              engender body image dissatisfaction. To date, most studies have
              demonstrated this relationship between appearance comparison and
              body image dissatisfaction in the context of conventional media
              images depicting the thin-ideal. Social comparison theory posits
              that people are more likely to compare themselves to similar
              others. Since social media forums such as Facebook involve one's
              peers, the current study aimed to determine whether the
              relationship between appearance comparison and body image
              dissatisfaction would be stronger for those exposed to social
              media images, compared to conventional media images. METHODS: A
              sample of 193 female first year university students were randomly
              allocated to view a series of either Facebook or conventional
              media thin-ideal images. Participants completed questionnaires
              assessing pre- and post- image exposure measures of thin-ideal
              internalisation, appearance comparison, self-esteem, Facebook use
              and eating disorder risk. RESULTS: Type of exposure was not found
              to moderate the relationship between appearance comparison and
              changes in body image dissatisfaction. When analysed according to
              exposure type, appearance comparison only significantly predicted
              body image dissatisfaction change for those exposed to Facebook,
              but not conventional media. Facebook use was found to predict
              higher baseline body image dissatisfaction and was associated
              with higher eating disorder risk. CONCLUSIONS: The findings
              suggest the importance of extending the body image
              dissatisfaction literature by taking into account emerging social
              media formats. It is recommended that interventions for body
              image dissatisfaction and eating disorders consider appearance
              comparison processes elicited by thin-ideal content on social
              media forums, such as Facebook, in addition to conventional
              media.",

              anorexia has been well established, little is known about the
              social consequences of ``clean dieting'' and orthorexia nervosa.
              In two studies, we examined the social stigma of clean dieting
              and orthorexia. METHOD: In Study 1, participants read a vignette
              describing a woman following a ``clean'' diet, a woman with
              anorexia, or a control target (minimal information about the
              individual). In Study 2, participants read a vignette describing
              a woman with orthorexia, a woman displaying identical orthorexic
              behaviors but without the orthorexia label, a woman with
              anorexia, or a control target. Participants then rated the target
              individual on a range of measures assessing stereotypes,
              emotions, and behavioral intentions toward the target. RESULTS:
              Study 1 found that the clean-dieting target was evaluated more
              negatively than the control target on some dimensions, but less
              negatively than the target with anorexia nervosa. Study 2 found
              that evaluations of the targets with orthorexia nervosa were more
              negative than evaluations of a control target, but did not differ
              from evaluations of the target with anorexia nervosa. Perceptions
              of the target's control over her behavior were associated with
              more positive evaluations (Studies 1 and 2), whereas perceptions
              of blame and responsibility for the condition were associated
              with more negative evaluations (Study 2). CONCLUSIONS: Overall,
              these findings highlight the potential negative social
              consequences of clean dieting and orthorexia nervosa, and point
              to perceptions of control and blame as potential mechanisms
              underlying the stigma of these conditions.",

              and causal mediation components of Beck's (1967, 1983) cognitive
              theory of depression. DESIGN: In order to allow for a stringent
              test of the aetiological component of Beck's theory, we used a
              short-term longitudinal design in which participants'
              dysfunctional attitudes were assessed prior to the occurrence of
              a negative event. METHODS: In all, 136 high school seniors
              applying to the University of Pennsylvania completed measures of
              depressed mood and dysfunctional attitudes 1-8 weeks before
              receiving their admissions decision (Time 1). The assessment of
              dysfunctional attitudes was preceded by a priming task designed
              to activate latent depressogenic schemata. Participants also
              completed measures of depressed mood, negative views of the self,
              and negative views of the future shortly after they received
              their admissions decision (Time 2) and four days later (Time 3).
              RESULTS: Consistent with the diathesis-stress component of Beck's
              theory, dysfunctional attitudes predicted increases in depressed
              mood immediately following a negative admissions outcome (Time
              2). In addition, consistent with the causal mediation component
              of the theory, in negative outcome students, the relationship
              between dysfunctional attitudes and increases in depressed mood
              was mediated by negative views of the future. Contrary to
              predictions, however, this relationship was not mediated by
              negative views of the self. In addition, contrary to predictions,
              dysfunctional attitudes did not predict enduring depressed mood
              after a negative outcome (Time 3). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with
              dysfunctional attitudes are likely to show increases in depressed
              mood following the occurrence of negative events. The
              relationship between dysfunctional attitudes and increases in
              depressed mood following the occurrence of negative events is
              mediated by negative views of the future.",

              white matter tracts using probabilistic streamline tractography
              and assess the strength of tract connectivity using mean
              fractional anisotropy. Both the SPD and ASD cohorts demonstrate
              decreased connectivity relative to controls in parieto-occipital
              tracts involved in sensory perception and multisensory
              integration. However, the ASD group alone shows impaired
              connectivity, relative to controls, in temporal tracts thought to
              subserve social-emotional processing. In addition to these group
              difference analyses, we take a dimensional approach to assessing
              the relationship between white matter connectivity and
              participant function. These correlational analyses reveal
              significant associations of white matter connectivity with
              auditory processing, working memory, social skills, and
              inattention across our three study groups. These findings help
              elucidate the roles of specific neural circuits in
              neurodevelopmental disorders, and begin to explore the
              dimensional relationship between critical cognitive functions and

              sites plays an important role in the fine tuning of gene
              expression. New technologies for the execution of 3'-end enriched
              RNA-seq allow genome-wide detection of the genes that exhibit
              significant APA site switching between different samples. Here,
              we show that the independence test gives better results than the
              linear trend test in detecting APA site-switching events. Further
              examination suggests that the discrepancy between these two
              statistical methods arises from complex APA site-switching events
              that cannot be represented by a simple change of average 3'-UTR
              length. In theory, the linear trend test is only effective in
              detecting these simple changes. We classify the switching events
              into four switching patterns: two simple patterns (3'-UTR
              shortening and lengthening) and two complex patterns. By
              comparing the results of the two statistical methods, we show
              that complex patterns account for 1/4 of all observed switching
              events that happen between normal and cancerous human breast cell
              lines. Because simple and complex switching patterns may convey
              different biological meanings, they merit separate study. We
              therefore propose to combine both the independence test and the
              linear trend test in practice. First, the independence test
              should be used to detect APA site switching; second, the linear
              trend test should be invoked to identify simple switching events;
              and third, those complex switching events that pass independence
              testing but fail linear trend testing can be identified.",

              so-called two-person psychologies in our field. The author begins
              by briefly describing a parallel to the recent history of
              psychoanalysis in the sudden rise and fall of scholastic
              philosophy in the 14th century. He then focuses on contemporary
              attacks on Freud's psychoanalysis as a science, based on the
              contention by two-person psychologists that free association by
              the patient and evenly hovering attention by the analyst are
              actually impossible. He reviews Freud's idea of psychoanalysis,
              discusses psychodynamic psychotherapy, both conceived as
              scientific treatment procedures, and describes the current
              assault on their metapsychological and epistemological
              foundations. Returning to the parallel between what happened to
              medieval scholasticism and what has happened to psychoanalysis,
              he examines why this happened, and the resulting fragmentation of
              psychoanalytic practice. The article concludes with suggestions
              for the integration of various schools of psychoanalysis,

              mRNA polyadenylation isoform choice. 3' untranslated regions
              regulate mRNA fate, and their choice is tightly controlled during

              that involved conventional care while taking into account
              considerations unique to CAM. In ethics, as with conventional
              care, the issues surrounding pediatric CAM use usually involve
              questions about who the appropriate decision-makers are, on what
              ethical principles should clinical decision-making rely, and what
              obligations arise on the part of physicians and other health care
              providers. Clinical decision-making is made more complex by the

              actual (e.g., I am thin) and desired ideal body image (e.g., I
              want to be thin). Body dissatisfaction was examined via
              self-report questionnaires and rating scales. As expected,
              differences in body dissatisfaction exerted a differential
              influence on the two IRAP scores. Specifically, the implicit
              belief that one is thin was lower in participants who exhibited a
              high degree of body dissatisfaction than in participants who
              exhibited a low degree of body dissatisfaction. In contrast, the
              implicit desire to be thin (i.e., thin ideal body image) was
              stronger in participants who exhibited a high level of body
              dissatisfaction than in participants who were less dissatisfied

              explicit body dissatisfaction, and explicit measures of actual

  abstract = "Background: An increasing number of clinicians point to similar
              clinical features between some children with High Intellectual
              Potential (HIP or ``Giftedness'' = Total IQ > 2 SD), and children
              with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) without intellectual or
              language delay, formerly diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome. Some
              of these common features are social interaction impairments,
              special interests, and in some cases high-verbal abilities. The
              aim of this article is to determine whether these similarities
              exist at more fundamental levels, other than clinical, and to
              explore the literature in order to provide empirical support for
              an overlap between ASD and HIP. Method: First, comparative
              studies between ASD and HIP children were sought. Because of a
              lack of data, the respective characteristics of ASD and HIP
              subjects were explored by a cross-sectional review of different
              areas of research. Emphasis was placed on psychometric and
              cognitive evaluations, experimental and developmental
              assessments, and neurobiological research, following a
              ``bottom-up'' procedure. Results: This review highlights the
              existence of similarities in the neurocognitive, developmental
              and neurobiological domains between these profiles, which require
              further study. In addition, the conclusions of several studies
              show that there are differences between HIP children with a
              homogeneous Intellectual Quotient profile and children with a
              heterogeneous Intellectual Quotient profile. Conclusion: HIP
              seems to cover different developmental profiles, one of which
              might share features with ASD. A new line of investigation
              providing a possible starting-point for future research is
              proposed. Its implications, interesting from both clinical and
              research perspectives, are discussed.",

  abstract = "CONTEXT: Research has suggested that the prevalence of young
              women with eating disorders (EDs) is increasing, but determining
              the exact prevalence of EDs within the female student-athlete
              (FS-A) population is difficult. Looking at certain traits may
              help us to identify their level of susceptibility to developing
              an ED. OBJECTIVE: To determine the susceptibility of FS-As to EDs
              in relation to self-concept, including self-esteem and body
              image. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Athletic training
              and health centers at National Collegiate Athletic Association
              Division I, II, and III institutions via e-mail questionnaire
              correspondence. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A total of 439
              FS-As from 17 participating institutions completed the
              questionnaires. The sample was primarily white (83.1\%) and
              underclass (61.8\%). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The questionnaire
              consisted of 4 parts: 3 subscales of the Eating Disorder
              Inventory-2, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, the Body Cathexis
              Scale, and demographic items. RESULTS: A total of 6.8\% of FS-As
              were susceptible to anorexia and 1.8\% were susceptible to
              bulimia. The majority of FS-As (61\%) reported normal self-esteem
              levels, whereas 29.4\% had high self-esteem. Overall, 64.5\% were
              satisfied and 23\% were very satisfied with their body image.
              CONCLUSIONS: These results are generally positive in that they
              suggest FS-As have high levels of self-concept and are at low
              risk to develop EDs. However, these findings do not mean that all
              concerns should be dismissed. Although more than 90\% of the
              respondents were not susceptible to an ED, there are still FS-As
              who may be. Athletic departments should evaluate their FS-As'
              levels of self-concept so that their susceptibility to EDs can be
              addressed. The emotional aspect of health care should be included
              in providing holistic care for student-athletes. Athletic
              trainers often are the primary health care providers for FS-As,
              so they should be made aware of this concern.",

              endonucleolytic cleavage, followed by the addition of a poly(A)
              tail. Through alternative polyadenylation, a gene can give rise
              to multiple mRNA isoforms that differ in the length of their 3'
              UTRs and hence in their susceptibility to post-transcriptional
              regulatory factors such as microRNAs. A series of recently
              conducted high-throughput studies of poly(A) site usage revealed
              an extensive tissue-specific control and drastic changes in the
              length of mRNA 3' UTRs upon induction of proliferation in resting
              cells. To understand the dynamics of poly(A) site choice, we

              double-strand DNA breaks. Flow cytometry indicated that 41.5\% of

              (GCMS). A total of 46 metabolites could be identified by GCMS in
              HepG2 cell lysates and 29 in HMCL-7304 lysates, most of which
              occurred in HepG2 cells. Principal Components Analysis (PCA)

              satiety index of common foods. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: Isoenergetic
              1000 kJ (240 kcal) servings of 38 foods separated into six food
              categories (fruits, bakery products, snack foods,
              carbohydrate-rich foods, protein-rich foods, breakfast cereals)
              were fed to groups of 11-13 subjects. Satiety ratings were
              obtained every 15 min over 120 min after which subjects were free
              to eat ad libitum from a standard range of foods and drinks. A
              satiety index (SI) score was calculated by dividing the area
              under the satiety response curve (AUC) for the test food by the
              group mean satiety AUC for white bread and multiplying by 100.
              Thus, white bread had an SI score of 100\% and the SI scores of
              the other foods were expressed as a percentage of white bread.
              RESULTS: There were significant differences in satiety both
              within and between the six food categories. The highest SI score
              was produced by boiled potatoes (323 +/- 51\%) which was
              seven-fold higher than the lowest SI score of the croissant (47
              +/- 17\%). Most foods (76\%) had an SI score greater than or
              equal to white bread. The amount of energy eaten immediately
              after 120 min correlated negatively with the mean satiety AUC
              responses (r = -0.37, P < 0.05, n = 43) thereby supporting the
              subjective satiety ratings. SI scores correlated positively with

              negatively with palatability ratings (r = -0.64, P < 0.001, n =

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to produce a validated
              satiety index of common foods. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: Isoenergetic
              1000 kJ (240 kcal) servings of 38 foods separated into six food
              categories (fruits, bakery products, snack foods,
              carbohydrate-rich foods, protein-rich foods, breakfast cereals)
              were fed to groups of 11-13 subjects. Satiety ratings were
              obtained every 15 min over 120 min after which subjects were free
              to eat ad libitum from a standard range of foods and drinks. A
              satiety index (SI) score was calculated by dividing the area
              under the satiety response curve (AUC) for the test food by the
              group mean satiety AUC for white bread and multiplying by 100.
              Thus, white bread had an SI score of 100\% and the SI scores of
              the other foods were expressed as a percentage of white bread.
              RESULTS: There were significant differences in satiety both
              within and between the six food categories. The highest SI score
              was produced by boiled potatoes (323 +/- 51\%) which was
              seven-fold higher than the lowest SI score of the croissant (47
              +/- 17\%). Most foods (76\%) had an SI score greater than or
              equal to white bread. The amount of energy eaten immediately
              after 120 min correlated negatively with the mean satiety AUC
              responses (r = -0.37, P < 0.05, n = 43) thereby supporting the
              subjective satiety ratings. SI scores correlated positively with
              the serving weight of the foods (r = 0.66, P < 0.001, n = 38) and
              negatively with palatability ratings (r = -0.64, P < 0.001, n =
              38). Protein, fibre, and water contents of the test foods
              correlated positively with SI scores (r = 0.37, P < 0.05, n = 38;
              r = 0.46, P < 0.01; and r = 0.64, P < 0.001; respectively)

               and distress. Along with the negative impact on the individual,
               previous reports have indicated that compulsive hoarding is not
               only impairing and substantially burdensome for family members,

               to impact family functioning and parent-adult child
               relationships in 199 adult children of hoarders. Results
               revealed that family functioning mediated the relationship

               which was mediated by family functioning. Increased family

  author   = "Vaswani, Meera and Linda, Farzana Kadar and Ramesh, Subramanyam",
  abstract = "The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have emerged
              as a major therapeutic advance in psychopharmacology. As a
              result, the discovery of these agents marks a milestone in
              neuropsychopharmacology and rational drug design, and has
              launched a new era in psychotropic drug development. Prior to the
              SSRIs, all psychotropic medications were the result of chance
              observation. In an attempt to develop a SSRI, researchers
              discovered a number of nontricyclic agents with amine-uptake
              inhibitory properties, acting on both noradrenergic and
              serotonergic neurons with considerable differences in potency. A
              given drug may affect one or more sites over its clinically
              relevant dosing range and may produce multiple and different
              clinical effects. The enhanced safety profile includes a reduced
              likelihood of pharmacodynamically mediated adverse drug-drug
              interactions by avoiding affects on sites that are not essential
              to the intended outcome. SSRIs were developed for inhibition of
              the neuronal uptake pump for serotonin (5-HT), a property shared
              with the TCAs, but without affecting the other various
              neuroreceptors or fast sodium channels. The therapeutic mechanism
              of action of SSRIs involves alteration in the 5-HT system. The
              plethora of biological substrates, receptors and pathways for
              5-HT are candidates to mediate not only the therapeutic actions
              of SSRIs, but also their side effects. A hypothesis to explain
              these immediate side effects is that 5-HT is increased at
              specific 5-HT receptor subtypes in discrete regions of the body
              where the relevant physiologic processes are regulated. Marked
              differences exist between the SSRIs with regard to effects on
              specific cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, and thus the likelihood
              of clinically important pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions.
              Although no clear relationship exists between the clinical
              efficacy, plasma concentration of SSRIs, nor any threshold that
              defines toxic concentrations, but therapeutic drug monitoring
              (TDM) may be useful in special populations, such as in elderly
              patients, poor metabolizers (PM) of sparteine (CYP2D6) or
              mephenytoin (CYP2C19), and patients with liver and kidney
              impairment. Several meta-analyses have reviewed the comparative
              efficacy of TCAs and SSRIs, and concluded that both TCAs and
              SSRIs have similar efficacy in the treatment of depression. SSRIs
              have demonstrated better efficacy and tolerability in the
              treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). They have also
              been found to be effective in the treatment for social anxiety
              disorder both in reducing total levels of social anxiety and in
              improving overall clinical condition. The benefit of SSRIs in
              anorexia nervosa (AN) is apparently short-term unless medication
              is given in the context of nutritional or behavioral therapy. No
              single antidepressant can ever be recommended for every patient,
              but in a vast majority of patients, SSRIs should be considered as
              one of the first-line drugs in the treatment of depression.",

              paper, we report on a new instrument to assess this: the
              Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ). Individuals score in the range
              0-50. Four groups of subjects were assessed: Group 1: 58 adults
              with Asperger syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism (HFA);
              Group 2: 174 randomly selected controls. Group 3: 840 students in
              Cambridge University; and Group 4: 16 winners of the UK
              Mathematics Olympiad. The adults with AS/HFA had a mean AQ score
              of 35.8 (SD = 6.5), significantly higher than Group 2 controls (M
              = 16.4, SD = 6.3). 80\% of the adults with AS/HFA scored 32+,
              versus 2\% of controls. Among the controls, men scored slightly
              but significantly higher than women. No women scored extremely
              highly (AQ score 34+) whereas 4\% of men did so. Twice as many
              men (40\%) as women (21\%) scored at intermediate levels (AQ
              score 20+). Among the AS/HFA group, male and female scores did
              not differ significantly. The students in Cambridge University
              did not differ from the randomly selected control group, but
              scientists (including mathematicians) scored significantly higher
              than both humanities and social sciences students, confirming an
              earlier study that autistic conditions are associated with
              scientific skills. Within the sciences, mathematicians scored
              highest. This was replicated in Group 4, the Mathematics Olympiad
              winners scoring significantly higher than the male Cambridge
              humanities students. 6\% of the student sample scored 32+ on the
              AQ. On interview, 11 out of 11 of these met three or more DSM-IV
              criteria for AS/HFA, and all were studying sciences/mathematics,
              and 7 of the 11 met threshold on these criteria. Test-retest and
              interrater reliability of the AQ was good. The AQ is thus a
              valuable instrument for rapidly quantifying where any given
              individual is situated on the continuum from autism to normality.

  abstract = "Participants in the sport of bodybuilding are judged by
              appearance rather than performance. In this respect, increased
              muscle size and definition are critical elements of success. The
              purpose of this review is to evaluate the literature and provide
              recommendations regarding macronutrient intake during both
              'off-season' and 'pre-contest' phases. Body builders attempt to
              increase muscle mass during the off-season (no competitive
              events), which may be the great majority of the year. During the
              off-season, it is advantageous for the bodybuilder to be in
              positive energy balance so that extra energy is available for
              muscle anabolism. Additionally, during the off-season, adequate
              protein must be available to provide amino acids for protein
              synthesis. For 6-12 weeks prior to competition, body builders
              attempt to retain muscle mass and reduce body fat to very low
              levels. During the pre-contest phase, the bodybuilder should be
              in negative energy balance so that body fat can be oxidised.
              Furthermore, during the pre-contest phase, protein intake must be
              adequate to maintain muscle mass. There is evidence that a
              relatively high protein intake (approximately 30\% of energy
              intake) will reduce lean mass loss relative to a lower protein
              intake (approximately 15\% of energy intake) during energy
              restriction. The higher protein intake will also provide a
              relatively large thermic effect that may aid in reducing body
              fat. In both the off-season and pre-contest phases, adequate
              dietary carbohydrate should be ingested (55-60\% of total energy
              intake) so that training intensity can be maintained. Excess
              dietary saturated fat can exacerbate coronary artery disease;
              however, low-fat diets result in a reduction in circulating
              testosterone. Thus, we suggest dietary fats comprise 15-20\% of
              the body builders' off-season and pre-contest diets. Consumption
              of protein/amino acids and carbohydrate immediately before and
              after training sessions may augment protein synthesis, muscle
              glycogen resynthesis and reduce protein degradation. The optimal
              rate of carbohydrate ingested immediately after a training
              session should be 1.2 g/kg/hour at 30-minute intervals for 4
              hours and the carbohydrate should be of high glycaemic index. In
              summary, the composition of diets for body builders should be
              55-60\% carbohydrate, 25-30\% protein and 15-20\% of fat, for
              both the off-season and pre-contest phases. During the off-season
              the diet should be slightly hyperenergetic (approximately 15\%
              increase in energy intake) and during the pre-contest phase the
              diet should be hypoenergetic (approximately 15\% decrease in
              energy intake).",

               Solution-focused brief therapy (SFBT) has been gaining momentum
               as a powerful therapeutic approach since its inception in the
               1980s. By focusing on solutions instead of problems, it asks
               clients to set concrete goals and to draw upon strengths in
               their lives that can help bring about the desired change for a
               preferred future. Addressing both researchers and practitioners,
               a distinguished cast of international, interdisciplinary
               contributors review the current state of research on SFBT

              for 24 weeks. Group II (n = 34) received fluoxetine (20 mg in the

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Orthorexia is a pathological fixation about the
              consumption of healthy food. The present study aimed to reveal
              the psychometric properties of the Turkish version of ORTO-15,
              which was developed to evaluate orthorexia, and to investigate
              the relationship betweenorthorexia, and eating attitude,
              obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and some demographic variables.
              METHOD: The study included 994 participants aged between 19 and
              66 years. ORTO-15, the Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory,
              and the Eating Attitude Test-40 were administered to the
              participants. RESULTS: A 3-factor solution with varimax rotation
              explained 40.62\% of the variance. When 4 items with factor
              loadings below+/- 0.50 were eliminated from ORTO-15, the
              Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.62. The remaining 11 items
              were thought to have statistically satisfactory properties for
              the Turkish version of ORTO and were collectively referred to as
              ORTO-11. This version was used to investigate the relationship
              between orthorexia, and eating attitude and obsessive-compulsive
              symptoms. Pathological eating attitude and obsessive-compulsive
              symptoms were related to orthorexia. Women exhibited more
              orthorexic symptoms then men. In the present study high a body
              mass index was an important variable for orthorexia, but only
              together with gender (female), pathological eating attitude, and
              increased obsessive-compulsive symptoms. The results,
              implications, and limitations of the study are discussed.
              CONCLUSION: ORTO-11 demonstrated statistically satisfactory
              properties. Orthorexia was related to pathological eating
              attitude and obsessive-compulsive symptoms; however, caution
              should be used when generalizing the reported results.",

              Cosmetic Act in 1938 and escalating with the 1962 Kefauver-Harris
              amendments, increasing pressure has been placed on pharmaceutical
              manufacturers to demonstrate that a drug's benefits outweigh its
              risks. Nowhere has the question of risk versus benefit come under
              greater scrutiny than with anorectics. After the approval in the
              1940s and 1950s of a number of amphetamine and amphetamine-like
              compounds for the treatment of obesity, the U.S. Food and Drug
              Administration struggled to define the efficacy and safety of
              these agents. Labeling restrictions on duration of use and
              warnings about abuse and addiction ultimately contributed to the
              reduced use of anorectics. That trend continued until the
              mid-1990s, when the off-label use of fenfluramine plus
              phentermine (fen-phen) and the approval of dexfenfluramine gave
              rise to widespread, long-term use of anorectics to treat obesity.
              The adverse effects that came to be associated with fenfluramine
              and dexfenfluramine, leading to their eventual withdrawal from
              the market, gave pause to regulators, physicians, patients, and
              drug companies alike. Sibutramine, the latest anorectic to enter
              the market, is now the focus of a landmark trial that is
              examining, for the first time, whether drug-induced weight loss
              reduces the risk for fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular disease.",

  abstract = "The Behavioral Satiety Sequence (BSS) is the name given to the
              orderly transitions of eating, activity grooming and resting
              measured during the postingestive period. Because the BSS is
              considered to reflect the operations of natural physiological
              processes underlying satiety, the sequence can be used to
              discriminate between different drugs (and other manipulations)
              that reduce food intake via these natural physiological
              mechanisms or those that do so by interference. The BSS is only
              produced by the presence of a caloric load in the gut, and the
              preabsorptive satiety factors (such as CCK) the caloric load
              triggers. The BSS is most accurately defined by continuous
              observation rather than time or event sampling techniques
              [Partial Time Sampling (PTS) or Momentary Time Sampling (MTS)].
              Continuous observation also allows the true duration and true
              frequency of each behavior to be analyzed. Continuous observation
              can be used to determine if the profiles associated with the
              reduction in food intake is caused by nausea, sedation,
              hyperactivity, or altered palatability of food. At the present
              time is it possible to identify a number of drugs whose
              suppression of food intake is associated with the disruption or
              preservation of the BSS. Drugs that increase synaptic 5-HT
              activity such d-fenfluramine, fluoxetine. and sibutramine all
              preserve the BSS and advance the onset of resting. The 5-HT1b/2c
              agonists mCPP and TFMPP and the 5-HT1b agonist CP-94,253 produce
              similar effects. However, the 5-HT2 agonist DOI and the 5-HT1a/1b
              agonist RU-24969 disrupt the BSS by inducing hyperactivity as
              does amphetamine. The 5-HT2 agonist MK-212 disrupts the BSS by
              inducing sedation. Selective dopamine agonists, at low doses,
              such as SKF-38393 (DA1) and LY-171555 (DA2) also preserve the
              BSS. However, detailed behavioral analysis of the effects of many
              recently discovered putative satiety factors remains to be

              40\%-50\% recovery rate. Most of these reviews have focused on
              reductions of binge eating and purging; however, the cognitive
              model of BN that underlies the CBT approach identifies three

              concern with shape and weight, fewer studies provided data on
              restraint and self-esteem. While generally favorable, evidence

  author    = "Scrinis, Gyorgy",
  abstract  = "Popularized by Michael Pollan in his best-selling In Defense of
               Food, Gyorgy Scrinis's concept of nutritionism refers to the
               reductive understanding of nutrients as the key indicators of
               healthy food -- an approach that has dominated nutrition
               science, dietary advice, and food marketing. Scrinis argues this
               ideology has narrowed and in some cases distorted our
               appreciation of food quality, such that even highly processed
               foods may be perceived as healthful depending on their content
               of ``good'' or ``bad'' nutrients. Investigating the butter
               versus margarine debate, the battle between low-fat, low-carb,
               and other weight-loss diets, and the food industry's strategic
               promotion of nutritionally enhanced foods, Scrinis reveals the
               scientific, social, and economic factors driving our modern
               fascination with nutrition.Scrinis develops an original
               framework and terminology for analyzing the characteristics and
               consequences of nutritionism since the late nineteenth century.
               He begins with the era of quantification, in which the idea of
               protective nutrients, caloric reductionism, and vitamins'
               curative effects took shape. He follows with the era of good and
               bad nutritionism, which set nutricentric dietary guidelines and
               defined the parameters of unhealthy nutrients; and concludes
               with our current era of functional nutritionism, in which the
               focus has shifted to targeted nutrients, superfoods, and optimal
               diets. Scrinis's research underscores the critical role of
               nutrition science and dietary advice in shaping our relationship
               to food and our bodies and in heightening our nutritional
               anxieties. He ultimately shows how nutritionism has aligned the
               demands and perceived needs of consumers with the commercial
               interests of food manufacturers and corporations. Scrinis also
               offers an alternative paradigm for assessing the healthfulness
               of foods -- the food quality paradigm -- that privileges food
               production and processing quality, cultural-traditional
               knowledge, and sensual-practical experience, and promotes less
               reductive forms of nutrition research and dietary advice.",

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Orthorexia nervosa (Greek: ortho--correct, right;
              orexis--appetite, desire) is a term introduced in 1997 by the
              American doctor Steven Bratman and is defined as a pathological
              fixation with righteous and healthy eating. Clear classification
              criteria oforthorexia have not been developed yet and there has
              been an on-going discussion whether it belongs to the group of
              eating disorders or the obsessive-compulsive disorders. AIM: The
              aim of this paper is to summarise briefly the current state of
              knowledge regarding orthorexia and to point out the difficulties
              connected with an attempt to classify it in a given disorders
              group as well as with the attempt to establish the classification
              criteria. DISCUSSION: Despite the fact that the problem of
              orthorexia has been signalled in the Polish media, it has neither
              been discussed nor published in the Polish medical literature
              yet. Orthorexia starts when a diet becomes an escape from
              life--everyday activities are dominated by planning, buying and
              preparing ``proper'' meals. Each departure from this regime
              causes anxiety and guilty conscience and leads to even further
              tightening of the dietary habits. According to Bratmann,
              orthorexia is connected with an illusory feeling of safety
              (preventing from diseases), the urge to exercise a full control
              over one's life (elimination of the unpredictable), ``a hidden
              conformism'' (eating philosophy helps in a subconscious way to
              achieve a culturally accepted model of a beautiful body), a
              search for spirituality and identity, and a desire for
              self-deprivation. CONCLUSIONS: The arguments presented in this
              paper substantiate the expediency of implementing the
              epidemiological studies which will show the scale of the problem,
              its prevalence and conditionings. Data obtained in this way
              should facilitate the verification of classification criteria and
              will also help to formulate the diagnostic criteria of
              orthorexia.",

              energy lunch meals high in either CHO or fat. The effect of these
              meals on satiety during the fluoxetine and placebo phases was

  abstract = "Over 35 years of research suggests that endogenous hypothalamic
              serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) plays an important part in
              within-meal satiation and post-meal satiety processes. Thus, the
              serotonin system has provided a viable target for weight control,
              critical to the action of at least two effective anti-obesity
              treatments, both producing clinically significant weight loss
              over a year or more. Numerous serotonin receptor subtypes have
              been identified; of these, serotonin 5-HT1B and 5-HT2C receptors
              have been specifically recognised as mediators of
              serotonin-induced satiety.A number of serotonergic drugs,
              including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs),
              dexfenfluramine and 5-HT2C receptor agonists, have been shown to
              significantly attenuate rodent bodyweight gain. This effect is
              strongly associated with marked hypophagia and is probably
              mediated by the hypothalamic melanocortin system. Additionally,
              sibutramine, dexfenfluramine, fluoxetine and the 5-HT2C receptor
              agonist chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) have all been shown to
              modify appetite in both lean and obese humans, resulting in
              reduced caloric intake. Clinical studies demonstrate serotonergic
              drugs specifically reduce appetite prior to and following the
              consumption of fixed caloric loads, and cause a reduction in
              pre-meal appetite and caloric intake at ad libitum meals. Weight
              loss in the obese has also been produced by treatment with both
              the serotonin precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan and the preferential
              5-HT2C receptor agonist mCPP.A new generation of 5-HT2C receptor
              selective agonists have been developed and at least one,
              lorcaserin (APD356), is currently undergoing clinical trials. In
              addition, 5-HT6 receptor antagonists such as PRX-07034 and
              BVT74316 have been shown to potently reduce food intake and
              bodyweight gain in rodent models and have recently entered
              clinical trials. However, the role of the 5-HT6 receptor in the
              expression of appetite remains to be determined. The hope is that
              these drugs will not only be free of their predecessors' adverse
              effect profiles, but will also be equally or more effective at
              regulating appetite and controlling bodyweight.",

               examined the phenomenology, correlates, and associated
               impairment of orthorexia in 404 undergraduate students. A
               battery of self-report questionnaires assessed orthorexia

  author   = "Brown, C M and Coscina, D V",
  abstract = "A variety of recent research has suggested that the feeding
              associated with enhanced neuropeptide Y (NPY) activity within the
              hypothalamus may operate in part by interacting antagonistically
              with other neural processes responsive to serotonin
              (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT). To test this possibility further,
              experiments were performed to determine if the magnitude of
              feeding produced by injecting NPY into the paraventricular
              nucleus (PVN) or the perifornical hypothalamus (PFH) was
              diminished by coinjections of 5-HT into these two sites or
              peripheral injections of the 5-HT agonist, d-fenfluramine. Adult
              male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted unilaterally with
              stainless steel cannulae aimed to terminate either in the PVN or
              the PFH. In both studies, NPY (235 pmol) produced significant
              feeding in both sites either 1 or 2 h after injection when
              compared to saline. This enhanced feeding response was
              significantly greater in the PFH 2 h after injection (40\% in the
              central study; 70\% in the peripheral study). Coinjection of 5-HT
              (6.3, 12.5, or 25.0 nmol) into either site had no effect on the
              induction of this NPY-induced feeding response. However,
              peripherally injected d-fenfluramine (0.32, 0.63, or 1.25 mg/kg)
              produced strong dose-dependent attenuation both 1- and 2-h food
              intake elicited by 235 pmol NPY in either site, with the PFH
              being proportionately more sensitive to this effect. Viewed
              together, these results suggest that the feeding-suppressant
              effects of systemic fenfluramine on hypothalamic NPY-induced
              feeding may operate largely via peripheral mechanisms and/or
              central ones that have little to do with its 5-HT agonistic
              effects within the PVN or PFH.",

               learning. Taking together, these processes make up an important
               aspect of learning and development. Developing these
               metacognitive abilities is not simply about becoming reflective

              problems, and feelings as well as to determine whether there are
              any differences between genders and among different age-groups.
              The research instrument was an Eating Habits Questionnaire (EHQ)
              which consisted of 35 items. There were 382 respondents involved
              in the study. The reliability and factor structure of the
              questionnaire were verified by using factor analysis. The results
              of MANOVA showed that there is a significant difference in the
              habits concerning healthy eating between men and women [F
              (3,378)=4.26, p=0.006; Wilks' Lambda=0.97]. When the results for
              the dependent variables (knowledge, problems, and feelings) were
              considered separately, it was determined that there is no
              significant difference between men and women, which confirms the
              results of the t-test. The effect of age on the three dimensions
              of healthy eating habits was examined within three age-groups, by
              using ANOVA. The results showed that knowledge about healthy
              eating increases with age [F (2,379)=6.14, p=0.002] as well as
              positive feelings which occur as a result of healthy eating [F

              among the age-groups only when it came to the 'knowledge'
              variable. This study is important as it shows the current state
              of awareness on healthy eating habits in the researched populace

              disorder assessments traditionally have measured a finite number
              of specific eating-disordered thoughts or actions. The current
              work presents a new instrument, the Yale-Brown-Cornell Eating
              Disorder Scale (YBC-EDS), that does not limit assessment to a
              particular set of eating-related concerns or behaviors. Rather,
              it assesses the severity of illness associated with an
              individual's unique symptomatology. Reliability and validity of
              this new, clinician-rated instrument was tested in two
              independent samples of DSM-III-R eating disorder patients. The
              YBC-EDS eight-item scale assessing severity of preoccupations and
              rituals, and a set of six provisional items for assessing
              motivation for change were both frequently endorsed and found to
              have excellent interrater reliability. Internal consistency was
              shown to be good for the set of eight core items and the set of
              six items related to motivation for change. The eight-item scale
              demonstrated aspects of convergent validity with other
              assessments of eating disorder symptomatology. The set of six

  abstract  = "Background: Orthorexia nervosa is the pathological obsession for
               consuming only biologically pure food that may lead to the
               development of specific ritualistic attitudes towards food
               preparation and the restriction of specific food groups that can
               be harmful to one's health (Zamora et al., 2005; Matera, 2012).
               Aim: Due to the rise in popularity with Instagram and online
               eating disorder communities, and the potential negative outcomes
               on psychosocial health, the purpose of this descriptive study
               was to investigate images tagged with \#orthorexia on Instagram
               over 7 days. Methods: A mixed methods approach was utilized for
               this study. A text analysis was conducted using the Netlytic
               program (Gruzd, 2016) to explore for emerging themes of
               discussion specifically using word count frequency, and a
               network analysis using both a name network (i.e., who mentions
               whom) and a chain network (i.e., who replies to whom) was
               performed. Among a subsample of images, author/image information
               was manually obtained, and a coding scheme (adapted from
               Tiggemann and Zaccardo, 2016) was implemented for a subsample of
               images (results pending). Results: Among the 4,533 records
               downloaded, there were 48,780 unique words associated with the
               posts (in the description of the picture or in the comment
               section). Majority of most commonly used words were associated
               with eating disorder recovery (i.e., 425 instances of
               \#edrecovery; 340 instances of \#recovery; 297 instances of
               \#eatingdisorderrecovery). The chain network/direct interactions
               analysis indicated a large online presence with 1,503 nodes
               (i.e., users) and 1,803 ties (i.e., direct replies between
               users). The coding of \#orthorexia images is pending but will
               help us further understand the orthorexia online community.
               Conclusions: As the network analysis and text analysis suggested
               an eating disorder recovery theme, this suggests that Instagram
               may be being used as a supportive and interactive community for
               those who have/had symptoms of orthorexia.",

              the most commonly used effective dose of fluoxetine in MDD (20
              mg) was also conducted. METHODS: Data were obtained from 25
              double-blind clinical trials involving 4016 patients with MDD
              randomized to treatment with fluoxetine 20 to 80 mg/d, TCAs, or
              placebo. The subanalysis included data from 6 trials involving
              1258 patients treated with fixed 20-mg doses of fluoxetine or
              placebo. Spontaneously reported treatment-emergent adverse
              events, reasons for discontinuation, and events leading to
              discontinuation were compared between groups. RESULTS: The age of
              the 4016 randomized patients ranged from 12 to 90 years, with a
              mean age of 46 years. Most patients were white (92\%), and 62\%
              were female. The age of the 1258 patients in the 20-mg fixed-dose
              population ranged from 18 to 90 years, with a mean age of 54
              years; as in the total population, most of these patients were
              white (92\%), and 57\% were female. The adverse-event profiles of
              fluoxetine and TCAs in these trials were consistent with the
              typical profiles of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and
              TCAs. At a dose of 20 mg/d, fluoxetine-treated patients had a
              discontinuation rate due to adverse events that was not
              statistically significantly different from that in placebo
              recipients. Discontinuation rates due to lack of efficacy were
              not significantly different between fluoxetine and TCAs. However,
              significantly more TCA-treated patients discontinued therapy
              because of adverse events and significantly fewer completed
              treatment compared with fluoxetine-treated patients (both, P or =
              2\%) leading to discontinuation were asthenia, dizziness,
              insomnia, nausea, nervousness, somnolence, and tremor in
              fluoxetine-treated patients and abnormal vision, agitation,
              constipation, dizziness, dry mouth, headache, nausea,
              nervousness, rash, somnolence, sweating, and tremor in
              TCA-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Data from this large series of
              clinical trials confirm that fluoxetine is well tolerated in the
              acute treatment of MDD in adults, especially at a dosage of 20
              mg/d, and is better tolerated than the recommended doses of TCAs.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening
              syndrome that is precipitated by the use of serotonergic drugs
              and overactivation of both the peripheral and central
              postsynaptic 5HT-1A and, most notably, 5HT-2A receptors. This
              syndrome consists of a combination of mental status changes,
              neuromuscular hyperactivity, and autonomic hyperactivity.
              Serotonin syndrome can occur via the therapeutic use of
              serotonergic drugs alone, an intentional overdose of serotonergic
              drugs, or classically, as a result of a complex drug interaction
              between two serotonergic drugs that work by different mechanisms.
              A multitude of drug combinations can result in serotonin
              syndrome. METHODS: This review describes the presentation and
              management of serotonin syndrome and discusses the drugs and
              interactions that can precipitate this syndrome with the goal of
              making physicians more alert and aware of this potentially fatal
              yet preventable syndrome. CONCLUSION: Many commonly used
              medications have proven to be the culprits of serotonin syndrome.
              Proper education and awareness about serotonin syndrome will
              improve the accuracy of diagnosis and promote the institution of
              the appropriate treatment that may prevent significant morbidity

              capsule formulation of Adderall designed to produce a therapeutic
              effect that lasts throughout the day with 1 morning dose. The
              primary objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and
              safety of SLI381 compared with placebo in the treatment of
              attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children in a
              naturalistic school and home setting. A secondary objective was
              to assess the diurnal variation in responses based on morning and
              afternoon assessments. METHODS: A multicenter, randomized,
              double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial was
              conducted at 47 sites. After a 1-week washout of any previous
              stimulant medication, patients were randomized to receive
              single-daily morning doses of placebo or SLI381 10 mg, 20 mg, or
              30 mg for 3 weeks. Participants aged 6 to 12 years inclusive who
              satisfied Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
              Fourth Edition criteria diagnosis of ADHD were included. The
              primary efficacy parameter was the Conners Global Index Scale for
              Teachers. Secondary efficacy parameters included the Conners
              Global Index Scale for Parents, the Clinical Global Impressions
              Scale for improvement, and the Parent Global Assessment for
              improvement. Safety was assessed by recording adverse events,
              laboratory tests, and vital signs at each visit during the study.
              Physical examinations and electrocardiograms were performed at
              the screening and the end of the study. RESULTS: Five hundred
              eighty-four children were randomized, 563 were included in the
              intent-to-treat population, and 509 completed the entire study.
              Intention-to-treat analysis of Conners Global Index Scale for
              Teachers and Conners Global Index Scale for Parents scores
              revealed significant improvement in morning, afternoon, and late
              afternoon behavior for all active treatment groups versus
              placebo. All active treatment groups showed significant
              dose-related improvement in behavior from baseline. Both the
              Clinical Global Impressions Scale for improvement and Parent
              Global Assessment for improvement showed all doses of SLI381 to
              be superior to placebo at treatment end and both confirmed the
              dose-response relationship between improvement and the SLI381
              dose. The incidence of spontaneously reported adverse events was
              low and similar for active treatments and placebo. CONCLUSIONS:
              SLI381 produced consistent, dose-related improvements on all
              measures of efficacy. The extended-release nature of the SLI381
              formulation was shown by continued, significant improvement in
              afternoon assessments by teachers and afternoon and late
              afternoon assessments by parents. The time course and therapeutic
              effects of SLI381 suggests that this medication is an efficacious
              once-daily treatment for children with ADHD.",

              analyses were used. RESULTS: In 1983, 5.9 per 1000 population
              aged 0 to 19 were dispensed at least 1 AD; this decreased to 5.1
              per 1000 population in 1989, and then increased to 15.4 per 1000
              population in 2007, with a slower increase after 2004. Both sexes
              were dispensed more ADs from 1989 onwards, with females being the
              heavier users. The rate of AD use increased significantly with
              age, and this trend became more pronounced after 1998. Family
              physicians were the major prescribers and their prescriptions
              significantly increased from 1989 to 2004 and decreased in 2007.
              The use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) was
              the major reason for the increase. The number of AD scripts per
              patient also increased. CONCLUSIONS: The growth in the prevalence
              of AD use among children and youth was largely caused by the use
              of SSRIs. The possibility of safety issues induced by AD use
              among children and adolescents, and different patterns of
              medication practice, suggest continuing education is warranted.",

              (IVS7), and the 353Arg-Gln polymorphism. All the polymorphisms,
              which showed strong allelic association, analyzed separately or
              in combination by the one-way analysis of variance, were
              associated with significantly different FVII levels. The 5'F7 and
              353Arg-Gln polymorphic systems, which have very similar allele
              frequencies, contributed to a similar extent to the total
              phenotypic variance, whereas the contribution of the IVS7
              polymorphism was lower. Genetic variation at the FVII locus,
              evaluated on combined genotypes, accounted for up to 40\% of the
              phenotype FVII variance. As also shown by the two-way analysis of
              variance, the use of two out of three markers is advisable, and
              since the 5'F7 polymorphism can be screened by a simple
              immunoassay, it should be preferred for population-based studies.
              No substantial differences between FVII activity and FVII antigen
              levels were found, thus suggesting that the variation was due to
              biosynthesis- or stability-mediated mechanisms. The genetic
              control of FVII levels described in this study plays an important
              role in determining plasma FVII level variability, which may

              investigated the effects of fluoxetine, which inhibits serotonin
              reuptake, on food intake and the activity of the neuropeptide
              Yergic arcuato-paraventricular projection in lean Wistar and

              which obesity is postulated to be due to overactivity of the
              arcuato-paraventricular projection. Fluoxetine significantly
              reduced food intake in lean and obese rats, both during
              continuous subcutaneous infusion and (10 mg/kg/day for seven
              days) and acutely after a single injection (10 mg/kg). Fluoxetine
              also significantly reduced neuropeptide Y levels in the
              paraventricular nucleus, a major site of neuropeptide Y release
              which is highly sensitive to the appetite-stimulating actions of
              neuropeptide Y. Push-pull sampling in lean and fatty Zucker rats
              showed that neuropeptide Y secretion in the paraventricular
              nucleus was significantly reduced after acute fluoxetine
              treatment. Furthermore, seven days fluoxetine treatment prevented
              the significant increases in hypothalamic neuropeptide Y
              messenger RNA which were induced in lean rats by food restriction
              which precisely matched the hypophagia induced by the drug. We
              conclude that fluoxetine inhibits various aspects of the activity
              of the neuropeptide Yergic arcuato-paraventricular neurons, and
              suggest that reduced neuropeptide Y release in the
              paraventricular nucleus may mediate, at least in part, the drug's
              hypophagic action. We further suggest that serotonin may
              influence food intake and energy balance by inhibiting the
              arcuato-paraventricular projection, and that the two
              neurotransmitters may act together to regulate feeding and energy
              homoeostasis.",

  author    = "Lee, L M and Henderson, D K",
  abstract  = "A substantial body of evidence provides support (but not
               definitive proof of efficacy) for the use of antiretroviral
               agents as postexposure prophylaxis for occupational exposures to
               HIV in the healthcare workplace. Despite the lack of definitive
               evidence of the efficacy of these agents in this setting, over
               the past decade this intervention has become the standard of
               care for healthcare workers who sustain occupational exposures
               to HIV. Administration of these agents--even for a relatively
               short 28-day postexposure course--is often fraught with
               difficulty. All of the agents currently used for postexposure
               prophylaxis regimens have substantial adverse effects, and
               significant adverse effects occur in more than two-thirds of
               individuals electing prophylaxis. This manuscript reiterates
               current US Federal Government guidelines for the administration
               of postexposure prophylaxis, specifically noting that zidovudine
               plus lamivudine (with or without a protease inhibitor) remains
               the recommended regimen. The paper summarises the significant
               toxicities associated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase
               inhibitors (primarily nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and bone
               marrow suppression), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase
               inhibitors (rash, fever, gastrointestinal symptoms and
               hepatitis, including hepatic decompensation necessitating liver
               transplantation) and protease inhibitors (nausea, vomiting,
               diarrhoea, abdominal pain, hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia,
               headache and anorexia). As a class, the antiretroviral agents
               have an extraordinary number of drug interactions. The
               non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and the protease
               inhibitors are metabolised through the cytochrome P450 pathway,
               and the effects of concomitant administration of protease
               inhibitors with other agents in the same class are discussed, as
               well as the effects of concomitant administration of protease
               inhibitors with non-nucleoside agents. The potential for
               numerous and medically risky drug interactions emphasises the
               importance of planning antiretroviral prophylaxis in
               consultation with practitioners or clinical pharmacists who are
               skilled in the use of these agents and knowledgeable about the
               potential for significant drug interactions that could either
               reduce the benefit of prophylaxis or increase the potential for
               toxicity. Another common problem encountered by individuals
               managing postexposure prophylaxis programmes relates to the
               administration of chemoprophylaxis to a pregnant healthcare
               worker who has sustained an occupational exposure to HIV. We
               address what is known about the potential for toxicity and
               emphasise the recently published warning concerning the deaths
               of pregnant women and their offspring from lactic acidosis while
