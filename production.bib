                   is anticipated to drive personalized medicine and improve
                   healthcare quality. Constructing predictive statistical
                   models typically requires extraction of curated predictor
                   variables from normalized EHR data, a labor-intensive
                   process that discards the vast majority of information in
                   each patient's record. We propose a representation of
                   patients' entire, raw EHR records based on the Fast
                   Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) format. We
                   demonstrate that deep learning methods using this
                   representation are capable of accurately predicting multiple
                   medical events from multiple centers without site-specific
                   data harmonization. We validated our approach using
                   de-identified EHR data from two U.S. academic medical
                   centers with 216,221 adult patients hospitalized for at
                   least 24 hours. In the sequential format we propose, this
                   volume of EHR data unrolled into a total of 46,864,534,945
                   data points, including clinical notes. Deep learning models
                   achieved high accuracy for tasks such as predicting
                   in-hospital mortality (AUROC across sites 0.93-0.94), 30-day
                   unplanned readmission (AUROC 0.75-0.76), prolonged length of
                   stay (AUROC 0.85-0.86), and all of a patient's final
                   discharge diagnoses (frequency-weighted AUROC 0.90). These
                   models outperformed state-of-the-art traditional predictive
                   models in all cases. We also present a case-study of a
                   neural-network attribution system, which illustrates how
                   clinicians can gain some transparency into the predictions.
                   We believe that this approach can be used to create accurate

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Primary care physicians are ideally positioned to
              affect a large population at risk for epidemics of sedentary
              lifestyle; however, it is unclear what type of counseling they
              provide. METHODS: A questionnaire was used to obtain information
              on primary care physicians' behaviors with respect to counseling
              and prescribing physical activity, physician demographics, and
              practice characteristics. Registered primary care physicians in
              Canada were contacted in all 10 provinces and 2 territories.
              RESULTS: Of 27 980 primary care physicians, 14 319 returned
              usable questionnaires and 13 166 were eligible for study
              participation (response rate, 51.2\%). Respondents were
              predominantly male (61.1\%), practiced in private office/clinic
              settings (73.4\%), and had graduated from medical school more
              than 22 years earlier. Eighty-five percent of respondents
              reported asking patients about their physical activity levels,
              whereas only 26.2\% assessed patient fitness as part of a
              physical examination or through a fitness test and only 10.9\%
              referred patients to others for fitness assessment or appraisal.
              Most physicians (69.8\%) reported using verbal counseling to
              promote physical activity, whereas only 15.8\% used written
              prescriptions for a physical activity promotion program. Male and
              female physicians responded differently. Men more frequently
              assessed fitness than did women, whereas women more frequently
              asked and provided verbal and written directions. CONCLUSIONS:
              This large sample of Canadian primary care physicians regularly
              asked patients about physical activity levels and advised them
              using verbal counseling. Few respondents provided written
              prescriptions, performed fitness assessments, or referred
              patients. These results suggest possible opportunities to improve
              physicians' counseling and prescription efforts.",

              migraine-preventive therapy. DESIGN: A 26-week, randomized,
              double-blind, placebo-controlled study. SETTING: Outpatient
              treatment at 49 US clinical centers. Patients Patients were aged
              12 to 65 years, had a 6-month International Headache Society
              migraine history, and experienced 3 to 12 migraines per month,
              but had 15 or fewer headache days per month during the 28-day
              baseline period. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to
              placebo or topiramate, 50, 100, or 200 mg/d, titrated by 25 mg/wk
              to the assigned dose or as tolerated in 8 weeks; maintenance
              therapy continued for 18 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The
              primary efficacy assessment was a reduction in mean monthly
              migraine frequency across the 6-month treatment phase. Secondary
              end points were responder rate, time to onset of action, mean
              change in migraine days per month, and mean change in rescue
              medication days per month. RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-seven
              patients were randomized, and 469 composed the intent-to-treat
              population. The mean +/- SD monthly migraine frequency decreased
              significantly for the 100-mg/d group (from 5.4 +/- 2.2 to 3.3 +/-
              2.9; P <.001) and the 200-mg/d group (from 5.6 +/- 2.6 to 3.3 +/-

              accuracy of depression screening instruments; (2) the effect of

              PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, ISI, SCOPUS, and Cochrane databases
              from inception to May 1, 2008; manual journal searches; reference
              list reviews; and citation tracking of included articles. STUDY
              SELECTION: We included articles in any language about patients in
              cardiovascular care settings that (1) compared a screening
              instrument to a valid major depressive disorder criterion
              standard; (2) compared depression treatment with placebo or usual
              care in a randomized controlled trial; or (3) assessed the effect
              of screening on depression identification and treatment rates,
              depression, or cardiac outcomes. DATA EXTRACTION: Methodological
              characteristics and outcomes were extracted by 2 investigators.
              RESULTS: We identified 11 studies about screening accuracy, 6
              depression treatment trials, but no studies that evaluated the
              effects of screening on depression or cardiovascular outcomes. In
              studies that tested depression screening instruments using a
              priori-defined cutoff scores, sensitivity ranged from 39\% to
              100\% (median, 84\%) and specificity ranged from 58\% to 94\%
              (median, 79\%). Depression treatment with medication or cognitive
              behavioral therapy resulted in modest reductions in depressive
              symptoms (effect size, 0.20-0.38; r(2), 1\%-4\%). There was no
              evidence that depression treatment improved cardiac outcomes.
              Among patients with depression and history of myocardial
              infarction in the ENRICHD trial, there was no difference in
              event-free survival between participants treated with cognitive
              behavioral therapy supplemented by an antidepressant vs usual
              care (75.5\% vs 74.7\%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Depression
              treatment with medication or cognitive behavioral therapy in
              patients with cardiovascular disease is associated with modest
              improvement in depressive symptoms but no improvement in cardiac
              outcomes. No clinical trials have assessed whether screening for
              depression improves depressive symptoms or cardiac outcomes in

              Ladra, J{\"u}rgen and Wrzosek, Anna",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Tracheostomy formation is one of the most commonly
              performed surgical procedures in critically ill intensive care
              participants requiring long-term mechanical ventilation. Both
              surgical tracheostomies (STs) and percutaneous tracheostomies
              (PTs) are used in current surgical practice; but until now, the
              optimal method of performing tracheostomies in critically ill
              participants remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the
              effectiveness and safety of percutaneous techniques compared to
              surgical techniques commonly used for elective tracheostomy in
              critically ill participants (adults and children) to assess
              whether there was a difference in complication rates between the
              procedures. We also assessed whether the effect varied between
              different groups of participants or settings (intensive care unit
              (ICU), operating room), different levels of operator experience,
              different percutaneous techniques, or whether the percutaneous
              techniques were carried out with or without bronchoscopic
              guidance. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following electronic
              databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL to 28 May 2015.
              We also searched reference lists of articles, 'grey literature',
              and dissertations. We handsearched intensive care and anaesthesia
              journals, abstracts, and proceedings of scientific meetings. We
              attempted to identify unpublished or ongoing studies by
              contacting manufacturers and experts in the field, and searching
              in trial registers. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized
              and quasi-randomized controlled trials (quasi-RCTs) comparing
              percutaneous techniques (experimental intervention) with surgical
              techniques (control intervention) used for elective tracheostomy
              in critically ill participants (adults and children). DATA
              COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three authors independently checked
              eligibility and extracted data on methodological quality,
              participant characteristics, intervention details, settings, and
              outcomes of interest using a standardized form. We then entered
              data into Review Manager 5, with a double-entry procedure. MAIN
              RESULTS: Of 785 identified citations, 20 trials from 1990 to 2011
              enrolling 1652 participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria. We
              judged most of the trials to be at low or unclear risk of bias
              across the six domains, and we judged four studies to have
              elements of high risk of bias; we did not classify any studies at
              overall low risk of bias. The quality of evidence was low for
              five of the seven outcomes (very low N = 1, moderate N = 1) and
              there was heterogeneity among the studies. There was a variety of
              adult participants and the procedures were performed by a wide
              range of differently experienced operators in different
              situations.There was no evidence of a difference in the rate of
              the primary outcomes: mortality directly related to the procedure
              (Peto odds ratio (POR) 0.52, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.10
              to 2.60, I² = 44\%, P = 0.42, 4 studies, 257 participants, low
              quality evidence); and serious, life-threatening adverse events -
              intraoperatively: risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95\% CI 0.57 to 1.53, I²
              = 27\%, P = 0.78, 12 studies, 1211 participants, low quality
              evidence,and direct postoperatively: RR 0.72, 95\% CI 0.41 to
              1.25, I² = 24\%, P = 0.24, 10 studies, 984 participants, low
              quality evidence.PTs significantly reduce the rate of the
              secondary outcome, wound infection/stomatitis by 76\% (RR 0.24,
              95\% CI 0.15 to 0.37, I² = 0\%, P < 0.00001, 12 studies, 936
              participants, moderate quality evidence) and the rate of
              unfavourable scarring by 75\% (RR 0.25, 95\% CI 0.07 to 0.91, I²
              = 86\%, P = 0.04, 6 studies, 789 participants, low quality
              evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in the rate of
              the secondary outcomes, major bleeding (RR 0.70, 95\% CI 0.45 to
              1.09, I² = 47\%, P = 0.12, 10 studies, 984 participants, very low
              quality evidence) and tracheostomy tube occlusion/obstruction,
              accidental decannulation, difficult tube change (RR 1.36, 95\% CI
              0.65 to 2.82, I² = 22\%, P = 0.42, 6 studies, 538 participants,
              low quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: When compared to
              STs, PTs significantly reduce the rate of wound
              infection/stomatitis (moderate quality evidence) and the rate of
              unfavourable scarring (low quality evidence due to imprecision
              and heterogeneity). In terms of mortality and the rate of serious
              adverse events, there was low quality evidence that
              non-significant positive effects exist for PTs. In terms of the
              rate of major bleeding, there was very low quality evidence that
              non-significant positive effects exist for PTs.However, because
              several groups of participants were excluded from the included
              studies, the number of participants in the included studies was
              limited, long-term outcomes were not evaluated, and data on
              participant-relevant outcomes were either sparse or not available
              for each study, the results of this meta-analysis are limited and
              cannot be applied to all critically ill adults.",

              laparoscopic surgery (LS) and open surgery (OS) for colorectal
              cancer. METHODS: An electronic search of the literature was
              undertaken to identify primary studies and systematic reviews.
              Information on the efficacy and safety of LS versus OS was
              analysed. A meta-analysis was conducted to examine long-term
              outcomes. RESULTS: A systematic review published in 2000 and 12
              more recent randomized clinical trials were identified. Compared
              with OS, LS reduced blood loss and pain, and resulted in a faster
              return of bowel function and earlier resumption of normal diet.
              Hospital stay was up to 2 days shorter after LS. No significant
              differences between the techniques were noted in the incidence of
              complications or postoperative mortality. The time required to
              complete LS was significantly longer (0.5-1.0 h more). No
              significant differences were found between the two procedures in
              terms of overall mortality, cancer-related mortality or disease
              recurrence. CONCLUSION: LS takes longer than OS but offers
              several short-term benefits. However, complication rates are
              similar for both procedures and no differences were found in
              long-term outcomes.",

  abstract = "Background The demands of academic life are considered to be
              increasingly stressful for students in higher education, but
              there is limited research about the extent to which those
              attending student counselling services experience difficulties
              relating to academic issues and how effective counselling is for
              them. Aim The study aimed to evaluate the reliable and clinically
              significant change for students with self-reported academic
              issues. Reliable change occurs when a change in the outcome being
              measured is not attributable to error, while clinically
              significant change occurs when a person moves from a clinical
              population to a healthy population after an intervention, in this
              case counselling. Methodology Pre-existing data from 129
              university students who had attended a student counselling
              service were analysed to determine levels of reliable change and
              clinically significant change. These data related to
              psychological status before and after counselling based on
              CORE-OM total scores; self-report of the impact of counselling on
              academic issues; and demographic variables. Findings In total,
              117 (92\%) of students reported experiencing academic issues to
              some extent. Counselling was found to result in reliable change
              for 67\% and clinically significant change for 40\% of those
              students reporting academic issues. Implications The results of
              the study suggest that, even where academic reasons are not the
              primary cause of referral to student counselling services, a
              significant number of students will also experience difficulties
              in these areas. Counselling was, however, shown to result in
              reliable and clinically significant change in a high percentage
              of those experiencing these additional difficulties.",

              ability of interventional cardiologists to accurately measure
              lesion length and select appropriate stents. Background
              Inaccurate measurement of lesion length during percutaneous
              coronary intervention (PCI) increases the risk of restenosis.
              Methods Interventional cardiologists (n?=?40) evaluated 25
              matched orthogonal angiographic images that were prescored using
              quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) by a core laboratory.
              Visual estimates of lesion length and stent length selection were
              compared to the maximum QCA value. A 2?4 mm stent overlap of both
              the proximal and distal lesion edges was considered to be
              optimal. Based on optimal stent overlap, accurate lesion lengths
              were those measured from ?1 to +4 mm from the QCA. Likewise,
              appropriate stent lengths were those that measured between +4 mm
              to +8 mm from the QCA value. Five images were repeated to assess
              intrarater variability. Results Lesion length measurements were
              short and long for 51.1\% (95\% CI 47.6?54.6\%) and 19.0\% (95\%
              CI 16.3?21.9\%) of the images, respectively. Stent length
              selections that were short and long were recorded for 55.0\%
              (95\% CI 51.5?58.5\%) and 22.8\% (95\% CI 19.9?25.8\%) of the
              images, respectively. Intrarater variability evaluation indicated
              that 38.5\% (95\% CI 31.7?45.6\%) of lesion length measurements
              and 37.5\% (95\% CI 30.8?44.6\%) of stent length selections were
              >3 mm different between the first and second evaluation of
              repeated images. Conclusions Visual estimation of coronary lesion
              length has a high degree of variability, which may lead to
              inappropriate stent selection. Improving the accuracy of lesion
              length measurement may improve patient outcomes. ? 2015 Wiley

              explained a total of 65.31\% of the variance. The PEP-S
              demonstrated very good internal reliability ($\alpha$ ranging
              from 0.88 to 0.98) and very good test-retest reliability over a
              3-week time-span (r ranging from 0.81 to 0.93). The PEP-S also
              showed excellent convergent and discriminant validity.
              Furthermore, the scale discriminated between women with high and
              low levels of eating psychopathology. The PEP-S is a
              psychometrically robust measure of pride in eating pathology. It
              has the potential to advance theoretical understanding and may
              also be clinically useful. Copyright \copyright{} 2015 John Wiley

              reliable, quick and easy to administer self-report questionnaire
              that measures pride related to eating pathology. The PEP-S
              assesses four clinically relevant dimensions: (1) pride in weight
              loss, food control and thinness, (2) pride in healthy weight and
              healthy eating, (3) pride in outperforming others and social
              recognition and (4) pride in capturing other people's attention
              due to extreme thinness. The PEP-S has very good internal and
              test-retest reliability, and very good convergent and
              discriminant validity. The PEP-S distinguishes between women with
              higher and lower levels of eating psychopathology. The PEP-S
              makes an important contribution to understanding pride in eating
              psychopathology, which is essential from both clinical and
              theoretical perspectives.",

  abstract = "Metacognitive theory, amongst other theories, gives an important
              role to beliefs about mental states, including beliefs about
              emotions, in the maintenance of distress. Mentalization theory as
              well as the dialectical behaviour therapy and emotion-focused
              therapy literature specifies particular beliefs thought to be
              related to emotion dysregulation and therefore to a label of
              borderline personality disorder. The current study aimed to
              develop a questionnaire to measure the beliefs about emotions as
              specified by this literature and to test the relationship of this
              new measure to various aspects of emotion regulation in a
              non-clinical sample of 289 participants. A factor analysis
              extracted six factors, which described beliefs about emotions as
              (a) overwhelming and uncontrollable; (b) shameful and irrational;
              (c) invalid and meaningless; (d) useless; (e) damaging; and (f)
              contagious. The final measure showed some promising psychometric
              properties. All of the questionnaire subscales were related to
              aspects of emotion dysregulation including distress, borderline
              personality disorder symptoms and behaviours associated with
              dysregulation of emotion, suggesting that beliefs about emotions
              could be an important metacognitive construct involved in the
              ability to regulate emotions. Beliefs about emotions may be a
              useful direct or indirect target for treatment of difficulties
              regulating emotions, and this could be achieved through the use

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Previous research suggests that hoarding aggregates
               in families and is associated with health and safety risks and
               family problems. The present study examined gender- and
               diagnosis-related differences in reports of hoarding symptoms
               among first-degree relatives of people who hoard, and of
               clinical and community samples. METHODS: The present study
               included 443 participants in a study of hoarding behavior: 217
               with hoarding disorder (HD), 96 with obsessive-compulsive
               disorder (OCD), and 130 nonclinical community controls (CC).
               Assessment included a detailed interview of familial patterns of
               hoarding behaviors among parents and siblings and measures of
               hoarding severity. RESULTS: In the combined sample, participants
               reported more hoarding among female (mothers, sisters) than male
               (fathers, brothers) relatives. Significantly more female than
               male participants indicated they had a parent or any
               first-degree relative with hoarding behaviors. However, within
               the HD sample no significant gender effects were found for
               household, safety, and functioning variables, or for hoarding
               symptom severity. In an age- and gender-matched subsample (total
               n = 150), HD participants reported more hallmark hoarding
               symptoms (difficulty discarding and saving/clutter), and
               acquiring among their relatives compared to OCD and CC samples,
               and parents had higher rates than siblings. CONCLUSIONS:
               Hoarding symptoms appear to be common among first-degree
               relatives of people who hoard and are also found among relatives
               of control samples. The predominance of hoarding symptoms among
               female relatives may indicate genetic or modeling transmission
               but this requires further study using large twin samples.
               Clinicians should consider that family members may also have
               significant hoarding symptoms.",

              eating disorders met criteria outlined in the 4th edition of the
              Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).
              METHOD: Six hundred sixty-eight patients recruited for the
              Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study (CLPS)
              were reliably assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for
              DSM-IV Axis I Disorders and the Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV
              Personality Disorders. The distribution of ED diagnoses was
              compared among four PD study groups (schizotypal, borderline,

              influences on body image and eating disturbances-the
              Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire (SATAQ).
              METHOD: Two independent samples of college females completed a
              revision and extension of the SATAQ and factor analyses were
              conducted to determine the underlying structure of the revised
              scale. RESULTS: Factor analyses indicated two distinct
              internalization factors: one appeared to reflect a generic media
              influence related to TV, magazines, and movies. A second factor
              clearly reflected internalization of athletic and sports figures.
              Two other factors, reflecting media pressures and media as an
              informational source, also emerged. Another widely used measure
              of thin-ideal internalization, the Ideal Body Internalization
              Scale-Revised (IBIS-R), was included in factor analyses to
              determine its empirical relationship with the revised SATAQ. None

              Eating-disturbed and eating-disordered samples had higher scores

              techniques for pedicle screw fixation have been published, but
              the results are unclear. Here, we assessed current evidence
              regarding the efficiency, safety and accuracy of RA compared with
              FH techniques. METHODS: A literature search of PubMed, Embase,
              the Cochrane Library and Web of Science was performed to compare
              the differences between RA and FH in spine surgery. Two reviewers
              independently reviewed included studies, conducted a risk of bias
              assessment, and extracted data. RESULTS: Three randomized
              controlled trials (RCTs) and six retrospective comparative
              studies included a total of 750 patients (3625 pedicle screws).
              No significant differences were noted between RA and FH in
              pedicle screw accuracy (95.5\% compared with 92.9\%; odds ratio:
              1.35; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.55 to 3.30; P=0.51),
              overall complication rate (1.33\% compared with 3.45\%; odds
              ratio: 0.46; 95\% CI, 0.15 to 1.43; P=0.18) and radiation
              exposure time (weighted mean difference [WMD]:8.49; 95\% CI,
              -15.43 to 32.40; P=0.49). While RA was associated with a longer
              operative time (WMD: 39.63; 95\% CI, 5.27 to 73.99; P= 0.02),
              percutaneous or minimal robot-assisted pedicle screw fixation

              procedures between 2006 and 2014: (1) anterior resection (AR),

              percentage of robotic surgeries (mean 67.2\%), and the number and

              Although several navigation methods have been proposed, an

              experiments are designed to evaluate the AR-guided distal

              regions of mRNAs, including the CPE, MBE, TCS, eCPE, and C-CPE.
              In addition to describing the role of general polyadenylation
              factors, we discuss the specific RNA binding protein families
              associated with cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements, including

              experimentally observed free radical electron (hydrogen atom)

              water soluble small molecule antioxidant, cooperate to protect

              management in intensive care unit (ICU) patients have produced
              controversial findings. The aim of this study was to critically

              orotracheal intubation (OTI) rate, first-attempt success, and
              complications related to intubation in ICU patients, compared to
              standard therapy, defined as direct laryngoscopy (DL). METHODS:
              We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized
              controlled trials, as well as prospective and retrospective
              observational studies, by searching PubMed, EMBASE, and
              bibliographies of articles retrieved. We screened for relevant
              studies that enrolled adults in whom the trachea was intubated in
              the ICU and compared VL to DL. We included studies reporting at
              least one clinical outcome of interest to perform a
              meta-analysis. We generated pooled odd ratios (OR) across
              studies. The primary outcome measure was difficult OTI. The
              secondary outcomes were first-attempt success, Cormack 3/4
              grades, and complications related to intubation (severe
              hypoxemia, severe cardiovascular collapse, airway injury,
              esophageal intubation). RESULTS: Nine trials with a total of
              2,133 participants (1,067 in DL and 1,066 in VL) were included in
              the current analysis. Compared to DL, VL reduced the risk of
              difficult OTI [OR 0.29 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.20-0.44,
              p < 0.001)], Cormack 3/4 grades [OR 0.26 (95\% CI 0.17-0.41, p <

  abstract  = "RATIONALE: The investigation of putative effects of early life
               stress (ELS) in humans on later behavior and neurobiology is a
               fast developing field. While epidemiological and neurobiological
               studies paint a somber picture of negative outcomes, relatively
               little attention has been devoted to integrating the breadth of
               findings concerning possible cognitive and emotional deficits
               associated with ELS. Emerging findings from longitudinal studies
               examining developmental trajectories of the brain in healthy
               samples may provide a new framework to understand mechanisms
               underlying ELS sequelae. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this review was
               twofold. The first was to summarize findings from longitudinal
               data on normative brain development. The second was to utilize
               this framework of normative brain development to interpret
               changes in developmental trajectories associated with deficits
               in cognitive and affective function following ELS. RESULTS: Five
               principles of normative brain development were identified and
               used to discuss behavioral and neural sequelae of ELS. Early
               adversity was found to be associated with deficits in a range of
               cognitive (cognitive performance, memory, and executive
               functioning) and affective (reward processing, processing of
               social and affective stimuli, and emotion regulation) functions.
               CONCLUSION: Three general conclusions emerge: (1) higher-order,
               complex cognitive and affective functions associated with brain
               regions undergoing protracted postnatal development are
               particularly vulnerable to the deleterious effects of ELS; (2)
               the amygdala is particularly sensitive to early ELS; and (3)
               several deficits, particularly those in the affective domain,
               appear to persist years after ELS has ceased and may increase
               risk for later psychopathology.",

  abstract = "The progressive increase of the social cost for treating
              urolithiasis could be related to an increased incidence of the
              disease and/or to an increase of costs for diagnosing and
              treating renal stones. In the course of the last century, the
              incidence of renal stones has progressively increased in Europe,
              North America, and other industrialised countries. This has been
              explained in terms of changing social conditions and the
              consequent changes in eating habits. In contrast, renal stones
              were less frequent than in developing countries of the world but
              in the last 20 years investigators began to report high
              incidences of upper urinary stone disease also from some areas of
              the Third World concurring with the changing of economic and
              social conditions. Each stone episode involves the costs for
              emergency visits, diagnostic work up, and medical or surgical
              treatment. Furthermore, we have to consider the costs of
              follow-up visits and the costs of testing and drugs for stone
              prevention. In adjunct of direct costs for diagnosis and
              treatment, we should also take into account the indirect
              individual and social cost of workdays lost. Finally, we should
              estimate the costs of complications and outcomes of treatment
              with particular attention to the costs of chronic renal failure
              secondary to stone disease. The strategy of treatment of each
              stone centre involves different costs for the treatment of each
              single stone episode. On the other hand the choice of treatment
              can be driven by National Health Systems and insurance companies
              by their policy of reimbursement for different procedures. The
              trends of renal stone incidence will have different impact on
              health care systems in different countries. In Europe and North
              America, the peak of incidence has been probably reached but the
              increase of costs for diagnosing and treating each single stone
              episode will still increase the social cost for managing stone
              disease. For this reason the actual objective should be to
              optimise protocols avoiding redundant or expensive diagnostic
              procedures or inappropriate treatments. In developing countries,
              the incidence of stone disease is still increasing and it could
              reach peaks even higher as a consequence of hot climate in some
              geographical areas. In those countries the demand for treatment
              of symptomatic stones could dramatically increase involving a
              huge financial outlay.",

              baseline screening CT scans and the impact diameter measurement
              methods have on performances. METHODS: From the Danish Lung
              Cancer Screening Trial database, 64 CTs with malignant nodules
              and 549 baseline CTs with benign nodules were included.
              Performance of the systems was evaluated applying the system's
              original diameter definitions: Dlongest-C (PanCan), DmeanAxial
              (NCCN), both obtained from axial sections, and Dmean3D
              (Lung-RADS). Subsequently all diameter definitions were applied
              uniformly to all systems. Areas under the ROC curves (AUC) were

              superiorly to Lung-RADS and NCCN (AUC 0.874 vs. 0.813, p = 0.003;
              0.874 vs. 0.836, p = 0.010), using the original diameter

              significantly influenced NCCN's performance with Dlongest-C being

              significant clinical burden for patients and relevant economic
              impact. Limited evidence exists on the management costs of NSCLC
              patients, especially in the late phases of the disease. The main
              objective of this analysis was to evaluate the economic impact of
              clinical management of NSCLC patients in the Italian population.
              METHODS: This evaluation was an economic analysis of the
              observational and multicentre study LIFE, which described the
              therapeutic approach in routine clinical practice for NSCLC
              patients, progressing after first-line treatment. This study
              evaluated resource consumption in different Italian hospitals,
              including specialist visits, hospitalizations, accesses to first
              aid, pharmacological treatment, laboratory tests and palliative
              care. The National Healthcare Service perspective was adopted.
              RESULTS: In this study, N = 191 patients enrolled in the LIFE
              study were included. Patients were aged 64.2 years and were
              predominantly males (66\%). In the different line of treatments,
              monthly costs of patients ranged between €1471 (first line) and
              €1788 (third line). The overall healthcare cost over the average
              period of observation (16.4 months) was €25,859 per patient.
              Overall, oncology therapy was the cost driver, although the
              composition of medical costs changed across the different lines
              of treatment, with costs for concomitant medication and
              palliative care being predominant in late phase of the disease.
              CONCLUSIONS: The economic burden of NSCLC is extremely high
              during the overall period of treatment, and a significant level
              of care is required in each stage of the disease.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic surgery has been an essential component
              of surgical education for the last two decades. The Accreditation
              Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) changed the
              requirements for laparoscopic cases beginning with graduates in
              2008, and the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery program was
              introduced over a decade ago as a method of measuring competency
              with laparoscopic techniques. The purpose of this study was to
              determine what changes have been made to meet these requirements
              and how these changes have impacted general surgery residents in
              their preparation to perform both basic and complex laparoscopic
              procedures upon completion of residency. METHODS: A 23-question
              survey was distributed electronically to all fourth- and
              fifth-year residents of United States general surgery residency
              programs. Respondents were queried about demographics, perception
              of surgical education, and their level of preparedness to perform
              laparoscopic cases upon graduation. RESULTS: The survey was
              completed by a total of 321 residents (174 fourth-year and 147
              fifth-year). Nineteen percent of respondents indicated that they
              anticipated problems meeting the new ACGME guidelines and 18.7\%
              of all respondents indicated that changes had been made to their
              program to meet those new requirements. The majority of residents
              felt they had adequate laparoscopic training upon graduation, but
              there was a disparity between program types. Despite this
              finding, more than one-third of respondents believed that it
              would be necessary to seek additional laparoscopic training
              post-residency graduation. CONCLUSION: Residency training
              programs have had to keep pace with evolving technology while
              preparing future surgeons to perform with confidence upon
              completion of residency training. The majority of residents feel
              their training has been adequate, but there are also a great
              number who believe they will need to continue their education in

              health professions education, courses vary considerably in
              quality. Many do not integrate efficiently into an overall
              school/program curriculum or conform to academic accreditation
              requirements. Moreover, some of the guidelines for simulation
              design are specialty specific. STUDY DESIGN: We designed a model
              that integrates best practices for effective simulation-based
              training and a modification of Kern et al.'s 6-step approach for
              curriculum development. We invited international simulation and
              health professions education experts to complete a questionnaire
              evaluating the model. We reviewed comments and suggested
              modifications from respondents and reached consensus on a revised
              version of the model. RESULTS: We recruited 17 simulation and
              education experts. They expressed a consensus on the seven
              proposed curricular steps: problem identification and general
              needs assessment, targeted needs assessment, goals and
              objectives, educational strategies, individual

              received several suggestions for descriptors that applied the
              steps to simulation, leading to some revisions in the model.

              significantly changed in the last 10 years, several advances have
              been made in visualization devices and instrumentation. METHODS:
              Our team, composed of surgeons and biomedical engineers,
              developed a magnetic levitation camera (MLC) with a magnetic
              internal mechanism dedicated to MIS. Three animal trials were

              ethical committee approval, and laparoscopic cholecystectomy,
              nephrectomy and hernioplastic repair have been performed.
              RESULTS: MLC permits to complete efficiently several two-port

              \% CI: 0.28-0.38, P < 0.01) in computer navigation group than
              that in fluoroscopy-guided navigation group; the operative time

              0.01) in computer navigation group than that in
              fluoroscopy-guided navigation group. The incidence of

              0.01) in computer navigation group than that in the other group.
              The intraoperative blood loss was fewer (WMD = -167.49, 95 \% CI:
              -266.39- -68.58, P < 0.01) in computer navigation group than that

              suboptimal systems for scheduling and locating patients and

              poor resource and room utilization. This paper proposes a Radio

              System for optimizing small healthcare facility operations,
              enabling further optimization of throughput time, room

              readers were equipped in strategic locations throughout the
              facility. Patients and medical staff were issued personalized
              RFID tags. When they pass through the reader's interrogation
              zone, it reads their RFID tag and sends the information to a
              central computer equipped with software capable of filtering the
              RFID data into useable information. A Visual Basic Application
              (VBA) program uses the information received from the ID tags to
              display the location of the patients and staff as they move
              throughout the facility. This increases their visibility within
              the facility by allowing medical staff to determine where their

              video-laryngoscopy appears to provide better glottic
              visualization than direct laryngoscopy. However, it remains
              unclear if it translates into increased success with intubation.
              METHODS: We systematically searched electronic databases,
              conference abstracts, and article references. We included trials
              in humans comparing Glidescope(\textregistered{})
              video-laryngoscopy to direct laryngoscopy regarding the glottic
              view, successful first-attempt intubation, and time to
              intubation. We generated pooled risk ratios or weighted mean
              differences across studies. Meta-regression was used to explore
              heterogeneity based on operator expertise and intubation
              difficulty. RESULTS: We included 17 trials with a total of 1,998
              patients. The pooled relative risk (RR) of grade 1 laryngoscopy
              (vs $\geq$ grade 2) for the Glidescope(\textregistered{}) was 2.0
              [95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.5 to 2.5]. Significant
              heterogeneity was partially explained by intubation difficulty
              using meta-regression analysis (P = 0.003). The pooled RR for
              nondifficult intubations of grade 1 laryngoscopy (vs $\geq$ grade
              2) was 1.5 (95\% CI 1.2 to 1.9), and for difficult intubations it
              was 3.5 (95\% CI 2.3 to 5.5). There was no difference between the
              Glidescope(\textregistered{}) and the direct laryngoscope
              regarding successful first-attempt intubation or time to
              intubation, although there was significant heterogeneity in both
              of these outcomes. In the two studies examining nonexperts,
              successful first-attempt intubation (RR 1.8, 95\% CI 1.4 to 2.4)
              and time to intubation (weighted mean difference -43 sec, 95\% CI
              -72 to -14 sec) were improved using the
              Glidescope(\textregistered{}). These benefits were not seen with

              Glidescope(\textregistered{}) video-laryngoscopy is associated

              to a three-week prehabilitation home-based program consisting of
              strength and endurance exercises as well as nutritional
              optimization. Remarkably, there were no episodes of postoperative
              confusion, and over the following eight weeks, she continued to
              show sustained improvement in exercise tolerance (as per the
              six-minute walk test), cognitive function (as per the Repeatable

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: An adequate airway management plan is essential for
              patient safety. Recently, new tools have been developed as
              alternatives to direct laryngoscopy and intubation. Among these,
              video-laryngoscopy has enjoyed a rapid increase in popularity and
              is now considered by many as the first-line technique in airway
              management. This paradigm shift may have an impact on patient
              safety. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Studies show that video-laryngoscopes
              are associated with better glottic visualization, a higher
              success rate for difficult airways, and a faster learning curve,
              resulting in a higher success rate for intubations by novice
              physicians. Thus, unanticipated difficult intubations may be less
              frequent if video-laryngoscopy is used as the first-line
              approach. In addition, on-screen viewing by the operator creates
              a new dynamic interaction during airway management. The entire
              operating room team can assess progress in real time, which
              enhances communication and improves teaching. However, if
              video-laryngoscopes become standard tools for tracheal
              intubation, these more costly devices will need to be widely
              available in all locations where airway management is conducted.
              Furthermore, algorithms for difficult intubation will require
              modification, and the question of selecting alternate devices
              will arise. If the incidence of difficult intubation decreases,
              the lack of motivation to teach and learn the use of alternative
              devices might adversely impact patient safety. CONCLUSION: The
              greater effectiveness of video-laryngoscopes associated with
              multi-person visualization could enhance overall patient safety
              during airway management. However, the routine use of
              video-laryngoscopy also introduces some issues that need to be
              addressed to avoid potentially dangerous pitfalls.",

              Airway Focus Group (CAFG) studied the unanticipated difficult
              airway and made recommendations on management in a 1998
              publication. The CAFG has since reconvened to examine more recent
              scientific literature on airway management. The Focus Group's
              mandate for this article was to arrive at updated practice
              recommendations for management of the unconscious/induced patient
              in whom difficult or failed tracheal intubation is encountered.
              METHODS: Nineteen clinicians with backgrounds in anesthesia,
              emergency medicine, and intensive care joined this iteration of
              the CAFG. Each member was assigned topics and conducted reviews
              of Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases. Results were
              presented and discussed during multiple teleconferences and two
              face-to-face meetings. When appropriate, evidence- or
              consensus-based recommendations were made together with assigned
              levels of evidence modelled after previously published criteria.
              CONCLUSIONS: The clinician must be aware of the potential for
              harm to the patient that can occur with multiple attempts at
              tracheal intubation. This likelihood can be minimized by moving
              early from an unsuccessful primary intubation technique to an
              alternative ``Plan B'' technique if oxygenation by face mask or
              ventilation using a supraglottic device is non-problematic.
              Irrespective of the technique(s) used, failure to achieve

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Lung cancer screening with low-dose computed
              tomography (LDCT) has been shown to deliver appreciable
              reductions in mortality in high-risk patients. However, in an era
              of constrained medical resources, the cost-effectiveness of such
              a program needs to be demonstrated. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this
              study was to systematically review the literature analyzing the
              cost-effectiveness of lung cancer screening using LDCT. METHODS:
              We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBM Reviews-Health Technology
              Assessment, the National Health Service Economic Evaluation
              Database (NHS-EED), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic
              Reviews. Due to technological progress in CT, we limited our
              search to studies published between January 2000 and December
              2014. Our search returned 393 unique results. After removing
              studies that did not meet our inclusion criteria, 13 studies
              remained. Costs are presented in 2014 US dollars (US\$). RESULTS:
              The results from the economic evaluations identified in this
              review were varied. All identified studies reported outcomes
              using either additional survival (life-years gained) or
              quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs gained). Results ranged from
              US\$18,452 to US\$66,480 per LYG and US\$27,756 to US\$243,077
              per QALY gained for repeated screening. The results of
              cost-effectiveness analyses were sensitive to several key model
              parameters, including the prevalence of lung cancer, cost of LDCT
              for screening, the proportion of lung cancer detected as
              localized disease, lead time bias, and, if included, the
              characteristics of a smoking cessation program. CONCLUSIONS: The
              cost-effectiveness of a lung cancer screening program using LDCT
              remains to be conclusively resolved. It is expected that its
              cost-effectiveness will largely depend on identifying an
              appropriate group of high-risk subjects.",

              related to orthorexia nervosa. The purpose of the present study
              was to validate the Polish version of the ORTHO-15 test. METHODS:
              341 women and 59 men (N = 400) were recruited, whose age ranged
              from 18 to 35 years. Mean age was 23.09 years (SD = 3.14) in
              women and 24.02 years (SD = 3.87) in men. The ORTHO-15 test and
              the EAT-26 test were used in the present study. RESULTS: Factor
              analysis (exploratory and confirmatory analysis) was used in the
              present study. Exploratory factor analysis performed on the
              initial 15 items from a random split half of the study group
              suggested a nine-item two-factor structure. Confirmatory factor
              analysis performed on the second randomly selected half of the
              study group supported this two-factor structure of the ORTHO-15
              test. The Polish version of the ORTHO-15 test demonstrated an
              internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) equal to 0.644.
              CONCLUSION: The Polish version of the ORTHO-15 test is a reliable
              and valuable instrument to assess obsessive attitudes related to

  abstract = "PURPOSE: Orthorexia nervosa (ON, i.e., fixation on righteous
              eating) is a poorly defined disordered eating behavior that
              results from a pathological obsession with food, its purported
              nutritional value, composition, origin, etc. METHODS: We
              investigated the prevalence of ON in a local ashtanga yoga
              community, by using a validated questionnaire (ORTO-15) that sets
              a threshold of ON diagnosis at $\leq$40. RESULTS: Among the 136
              respondents, the mean ORTO-15 score (which was normally
              distributed) was 35.27 $\pm$ 3.69, i.e., 86 \% of respondents had
              an ORTO-15 score lower than 40 and no significant association
              with age or BMI was recorded. When we analyzed the differential
              distribution of orthorexia in our cohort, we recorded an
              association of ORTO-15 score and vegetarianism, i.e., the ORTO-15
              score was lower among vegetarians. CONCLUSIONS: The results of
              this pilot study should suggest ashtanga yoga teachers to avoid
              excessive reference to a healthy diet, which is natural component
              of yoga practice.",

              Scales Questionnaire (RSQ), and Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale
              (RSES). RESULTS: Correlation analysis revealed that higher
              orthorexic tendencies significantly correlated with higher scores
              for perfectionism (self-oriented, others-oriented and socially
              prescribed), appearance orientation, overweight preoccupation,
              self-classified weight, and fearful and dismissing attachment
              styles. Higher orthorexic tendencies also correlated with lower
              scores for body areas satisfaction and a secure attachment style.
              There was no significant correlation between orthorexia nervosa
              and self-esteem. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed
              that overweight preoccupation, appearance orientation and the
              presence of an eating disorder history were significant
              predictors of orthorexia nervosa with a history of an eating
              disorder being the strongest predictor. CONCLUSIONS: Orthorexia
              nervosa shares similarities with anorexia nervosa and bulimia
              nervosa with regards to perfectionism, body image attitudes, and
              attachment style. In addition, a history of an eating disorder
              strongly predicts orthorexia nervosa. These findings suggest that
              these disorders might be on the same spectrum of disordered
              eating.",

  abstract  = "PURPOSE: Social media use is ever increasing amongst young
               adults and has previously been shown to have negative effects on
               body image, depression, social comparison, and disordered
               eating. One eating disorder of interest in this context is
               orthorexia nervosa, an obsession with eating healthily. High
               orthorexia nervosa prevalence has been found in populations who
               take an active interest in their health and body and is
               frequently comorbid with anorexia nervosa. Here, we investigate
               links between social media use, in particularly Instagram and
               orthorexia nervosa symptoms. METHODS: We conducted an online
               survey of social media users (N = 680) following health food
               accounts. We assessed their social media use, eating behaviours,
               and orthorexia nervosa symptoms using the ORTO-15 inventory.
               RESULTS: Higher Instagram use was associated with a greater
               tendency towards orthorexia nervosa, with no other social media
               channel having this effect. In exploratory analyses Twitter
               showed a small positive association with orthorexia symptoms.
               BMI and age had no association with orthorexia nervosa. The
               prevalence of orthorexia nervosa among the study population was
               49\%, which is significantly higher than the general population
               (<1\%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the healthy eating
               community on Instagram has a high prevalence of orthorexia
               symptoms, with higher Instagram use being linked to increased
               symptoms. These findings highlight the implications social media
               can have on psychological wellbeing, and the influence social
               media 'celebrities' may have over hundreds of thousands of
               individuals. These results may also have clinical implications

              is imperative to understand how resources are used to diagnose
              and treat this disease. This paper describes a method of
              modelling the direct patient care costs for lung cancer from the
              perspective of the government as payer in a universal health care
              system. Clinical algorithms were developed to describe the
              management of non-small cell (NSCLC) and small cell (SCLC) lung
              cancer. Patients were allocated to the treatment algorithms in
              the model based on a knowledge of their distribution by cell type
              and stage in Canadian cases. A microsimulation model developed by
              Statistics Canada was used to integrate the data on type of lung
              cancer, extent of disease, clinical management, survival and
              health care resource utilization. The direct care costs for
              diagnosis and treatment of NSCLC ranged from \$Cdn 17 889 for the
              surgery/post-operative radiotherapy treatment of Stages I and II
              to \$Cdn 6333 for supportive care for patients with Stage IV
              disease. The costs of determining relapse for NSCLC were
              estimated to be \$Cdn 1528 and terminal care costs, made up
              largely of hospitalization charges and some palliative
              radiotherapy, were \$Cdn 10 331. Direct care costs for the
              diagnosis and initial treatment of SCLC ranged from \$Cdn 18 691
              for management of limited stage disease to \$Cdn 4739 for the
              supportive care of patients with extensive disease. The cost of
              determining relapse for SCLC was estimated to be \$Cdn 1590 and
              terminal care costs averaged \$Cdn 9966. For all 15 624 cases of
              lung cancer diagnosed in Canada in 1988, it was estimated that
              the total cost of providing treatment and follow-up, and managing
              relapse over 5 years was \$Cdn 328 million. Despite the large
              total cost of lung cancer management, estimates of cost
              effectiveness of therapy showed that the cost per life year
              gained was approximately \$Cdn 11 000 for NSCLC and \$Cdn 19 560
              for SCLC. These estimates of the direct health care costs assume
              that all patients have access to care, treatment is uncomplicated
              and practice is standard, and must be viewed as an idealized
              assessment of the cost of lung cancer management. The
              microsimulation model, however, does provide a useful framework

  author   = "Hickey, Tom and Dean, Kathryn and Holstein, Bjorn E",
  abstract = "Increases in the world's older population have posed a
              significant challenge to available health care resources. For
              many older people, informal initiatives represent a necessary,
              rather than an optional health care strategy in the absence of
              alternatives. Those individuals with the greatest health and
              economic dependencies are often held responsible for their
              reliance on subsidized long-term care services. This tendency to
              blame the victim appears to transcend fundamental philosophic
              differences which have traditionally distinguished some
              collectivist and individualist societies. Although health care
              has been viewed traditionally by health professionals as their
              domain, self-care and lay initiatives have recently been
              recognized by professionals as important to the health care of
              different population groups including older people. The concept
              of self-care has been used in various ways by different people to
              describe a wide range of personal health behaviors encompassing
              lay care, self-help, enlightened consumerism, and various
              preventive measures as antidotes to the impairments of old age.
              This paper reports some of the outcomes of an international
              project which reviewed geriatric self-care in different countries
              and health care systems. Various influences on the evolution of
              interest in geriatric self-care were identified including:
              similarities and differences in health care systems: demographic
              changes; cohort differences; the emergence of professionals with
              specialized training in geriatric health care; and, the salience
              of biomedical models in addressing the health problems of aging.
              The role of professionals, especially those trained in
              geriatrics, is examined with an acknowledgment of the importance
              of a self-care strategy that is independent of professional
              dominance. The increasing inadequacy of health care systems to
              deal with a burgeoning older population makes it especially
              important for professionals and consumers to work together on the
              development of health care initiatives which decrease dependency
              on formal services and support positive health behavior. As more
              people move into old age, an increasing number will be better
              informed about their own health and about the health care system,
              and also more interested in prevention and health maintenance.
              They may also be less likely to defer to the professional's
              judgment in making health care decisions. This paper concludes
              with a caution regarding self-care as a potential `two-edged
              sword.' For the somewhat healthier and better educated elderly,
              effective self-care will be an important tool of prevention,
              health maintenance, and consumer protection. For the chronically
              impaired and most dependent elderly, self-treatment may be their
              only, and often inadequate resource.",

              the primary and microscopic tumors, and the complete removal of
              cancer. Although there have been efforts to adapt
              traditional-imaging modalities for intraoperative image guidance,
              they suffer from several constraints such as large hardware
              footprint, high-operation cost, and disruption of the surgical

              Service personnel were identical except that the hospitalist
              service also had a nurse discharge planner. Hospitalists attended
              4 months per year (compared with the 1 month by most other
              attending physicians) and had no outpatient responsibilities
              during the ward months. Patients were admitted alternately based
              on resident call schedule. Major outcomes included average costs
              of hospitalization, length of stay, and resource utilization.
              Quality measures included inpatient mortality, 30-day readmission
              rates, and satisfaction of patients, residents and students.
              Results Hospitalist-attended services had lower mean ($\pm$ SD)
              inpatient costs per patient ($4289 \pm $6512) compared with
              specialist-staffed services ($6066 \pm $7550, P < 0.0001), with a
              trend toward lower costs when compared with generalist-attended
              services ($4850 \pm $7027, P = 0.11). Hospitalist services had
              shorter mean lengths of stay (4.4 $\pm$ 4.0 days), compared with
              generalists (5.2 $\pm$ 5.2 days) and specialists (6.0 $\pm$ 5.5
              days, P < 0.0001 for hospitalists vs. both groups). Readmission
              rates were similar in all groups. Mortality rates were higher in
              the specialist group [5.0\% (44 of 874)] compared with
              hospitalists [2.2\% (18 of 829)] and generalists [2.6\% (20 of

               Acceptance and Commitment Therapy have a small but growing body
               of outcome research supporting these procedures and the
               theoretical mechanisms thought to be responsible for them.
               Functional Analytic Psychotherapy has a limited research base,
               but its central claim is well substantiated. The claims made in
               the published literature about these technologies, at least by
               their originators, seem proportionate to the strength of the
               current evidence. There is no indication that those interested
               in the new wave of behavior therapy innovations are less
               committed to empirical evaluation than has always been the case
               in behavior therapy.",

               behavioral principles targeting directly relevant clinical
               targets. The second wave was characterized by similar direct
               change efforts guided by social learning and cognitive
               principles that included cognitive in addition to behavioral and
               emotive targets. Various factors seem to have set the stage for
               a third wave, including anomalies in the current literature and
               philosophical changes. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)
               is one of a number of new interventions from both behavioral and
               cognitive wings that seem to be moving the field in a different
               direction. ACT is explicitly contextualistic and is based on a
               basic experimental analysis of human language and cognition,
               Relational Frame Theory (RFT). RFT explains why cognitive fusion
               and experiential avoidance are both ubiquitous and harmful. ACT
               targets these processes and is producing supportive data both at
               the process and outcome level. The third-wave treatments are
               characterized by openness to older clinical traditions, a focus
               on second order and contextual change, an emphasis of function
               over form, and the construction of flexible and effective
               repertoires, among other features. They build on the first- and
               second-wave treatments, but seem to be carrying the behavior

               communication and unusually restricted, repetitive behaviour and
               interests. The worldwide population prevalence is about 1\%.
               Autism affects more male than female individuals, and
               comorbidity is common (>70\% have concurrent conditions).
               Individuals with autism have atypical cognitive profiles, such
               as impaired social cognition and social perception, executive
               dysfunction, and atypical perceptual and information processing.
               These profiles are underpinned by atypical neural development at
               the systems level. Genetics has a key role in the aetiology of
               autism, in conjunction with developmentally early environmental
               factors. Large-effect rare mutations and small-effect common

               conducted in private-practice psychiatric outpatient clinics.
               Following a 1-week, single-masked, placebo lead-in period,
               patients received bupropion SR for 8 weeks (study 1: 150 or 300

               events, patient discontinuation rates, changes in weight, vital
               signs, and clinical laboratory test results. Across studies, the
               most frequently reported adverse events were headache, dry

               significantly more often in bupropion SR-treated patients than
               in patients who received placebo (P<0.05). Nearly all (94\% to

              diagnoses was for ON-40 = 45.8\% and ON-35, 76.5\%. It was shown
              that the OCD increases the risk of ON at the threshold value ON =

              ON-40, 42.7\% and ON-35, 84.4\%. The analysis of various

              disorder in which the person is excessively preoccupied with
              healthy food. First described by Bratman in 1997, ON entails a
              fixation on healthy food or a health food dependence. The term
              orthorexia nervosa arises from the Greek words orthos (=accurate)
              and orexis (=hunger) meaning obsession with healthy food and
              proper nutrition. Fears and worries about health, eating, and the
              quality of food are significant. Objectives We investigated the
              prevalence of ON in a a population of young Italian adults by
              using a validated questionnaire (ORTO-15). Aims We aimed to
              assess the prevalence of ON in a large sample of general
              population and to identify some possible specific correlation
              such as gender and Body Mass Index (BMI). Methods 1453 adult
              subjects from the general population were administered the
              ORTO-15 test and investigated for gender, age and BMI.
              Statistical analyses were performed referring to diagnostic
              threshold (40). Results Orthorexia had a 10,9\% prevalence in our
              sample, with a female prevalence statistically significant
              (female vs male= 72,8\% vs 27,2\%). Moreover, age and Body Mass
              Index did not seem to be significant factors. Conclusions ON is
              not currently considered as a full-fledged and discrete mental
              disorder. Again, the definition and diagnostic criteria of ON
              remain unclear. Further studies are needed to clarify appropriate
              diagnostic methods and the place of ON among psychopathological
              categories. This should be accompanied by a vigorous research

              assess the efficacy of a risk prediction model to select
              candidates for lung cancer screening, with the aim of determining
              whether this approach could better detect patients with early,
              potentially curable, lung cancer. We did this single-arm,
              prospective study in eight centres across Canada. We recruited
              participants aged 50--75 years, who had smoked at some point in
              their life (ever-smokers), and who did not have a self-reported
              history of lung cancer. Participants had at least a 2\% 6-year
              risk of lung cancer as estimated by the PanCan model, a precursor
              to the validated PLCOm2012 model. Risk variables in the model
              were age, smoking duration, pack-years, family history of lung
              cancer, education level, body-mass index, chest x-ray in the past
              3 years, and history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
              Individuals were screened with low-dose CT at baseline (T0), and
              at 1 (T1) and 4 (T4) years post-baseline. The primary outcome of
              the study was incidence of lung cancer. This study is registered

              into the study coordinating centre and were screened for PanCan
              risk. 15 were duplicates, so 7044 participants were considered
              for enrolment. Between Sept 24, 2008, and Dec 17, 2010, we
              recruited and enrolled 2537 eligible ever-smokers. After a median
              follow-up of 5·5 years (IQR 3·2--6·1), 172 lung cancers were
              diagnosed in 164 individuals (cumulative incidence 0·065 [95\% CI
              0·055--0·075], incidence rate 138·1 per 10 000 person-years
              [117·8--160·9]). There were ten interval lung cancers (6\% of
              lung cancers and 6\% of individuals with cancer): one diagnosed
              between T0 and T1, and nine between T1 and T4. Cumulative
              incidence was significantly higher than that observed in NLST
              (4·0\%; p<0·0001). Compared with 593 (57\%) of 1040 lung cancers
              observed in NLST, 133 (77\%) of 172 lung cancers in the PanCan
              Study were early stage (I or II; p<0·0001). The PanCan model was
              effective in identifying individuals who were subsequently
              diagnosed with early, potentially curable, lung cancer. The
              incidence of cancers detected and the proportion of early stage
              cancers in the screened population was higher than observed in
              previous studies. This approach should be considered for adoption

              Subjects and methods This retrospective cohort study of 10 595
              patients was conducted between July 2001 and June 2002 in a
              tertiary care community-based teaching hospital. Risk-adjusted

              in-hospital and 30-day mortality were measured for patients
              treated by Community Physicians, Private Hospitalists and
              Academic Hospitalists. Results There was a 20\% reduction in
              length of stay on the Academic Hospitalist service (p <.0001) and
              8\% on the Private Hospitalist service (P = .049) compared with
              Community Physicians. Similarly, total costs were 10\% less on
              the Academic (P <.0001) and 6\% less on the Private Hospitalist
              (P = .02) services compared with Community Physicians. The length
              of stay of Academic Hospitalists was 13\% shorter than that of
              Private Hospitalists (P = .002); differences in costs between
              hospitalist groups were not statistically significant.

              78\% (4,513/5,768; 95\% CI 77\% to 79\%) of initial attempts: it
              resulted in 85\% (3,843/4,513; 95\% CI 84\% to 86\%) success on

              (50/5,757; 95\% CI 0.6\% to 1.1\%). When an initial intubator
              failed, 40\% (385/954; 95\% CI 37\% to 44\%) of rescue attempts
              were performed by emergency medicine residents. Among emergency

              research, which reached out to the entire 318 MD. The ORTO-15

              below 40 from the ORTO-15 test are accepted to have ON.
              Chi-square test, ANOVA (univariate) analysis and logistic
              regression were used for analyses of the data. Mean score of the
              participants from the ORTO-15 test is 39.8+/-0.22, and there is

              than men of their physical appearance and weight control and
              consume less caloric food, which is statistically significant.
              Since those who exhibit ``healthy fanatic'' eating habits may
              have a risk of ON in the future, it would be useful to conduct

              tool, and the majority of ON research has been conducted among
              European populations. The present study explored the Bratman

              college students with a mean age of 22 years was recruited to
              complete an online survey that included the BOT, Eating Attitudes
              Test-26 (EAT-26), Body Dysmorphic Disorder Questionnaire (BDDQ),
              Obsessive Compulsive Inventory, Revised (OCI-R) and demographics.
              Spearman correlation, Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis, chi-square,
              and multiple linear regressions were used for analyses. The
              average BOT score was 4.71, near the ``health fanatic'' range,

              Significant positive correlations were observed between total BOT

              in some form for over 2 decades, claiming to improve total joint
              arthroplasty by enhancing the surgeon's ability to reproduce
              alignment and therefore better restore normal kinematics. Various
              current systems include a robotic arm, robotic-guided cutting
              jigs, and robotic milling systems with a diversity of different
              navigation strategies using active, semiactive, or passive
              control systems. Semiactive systems have become dominant,
              providing a haptic window through which the surgeon is able to
              consistently prepare an arthroplasty based on preoperative
              planning. A review of previous designs and clinical studies
              demonstrate that these robotic systems decrease variability and
              increase precision, primarily focusing on component positioning
              and alignment. Some early clinical results indicate decreased

              capacity, improved accuracy and precision, and lower cost. A new

              arthroplasty and total hip arthroplasty have demonstrated
              improved accuracy of placement, improved satisfaction, and

              and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). We studied the
              relative cost-effective initial diagnostic strategy for a 1.5- to
              2-cm nodule suggestive of cancer. METHODS: A decision analysis
              model was developed to assess the costs and outcomes of four
              initial diagnostic strategies for diagnosis of a 1.5- to 2-cm
              nodule with either a 50\% or 65\% pretest probability of cancer.
              Medicare reimbursement rates were used for costs.
              Quality-adjusted life years were estimated using patient survival
              based on pathologic staging and utilities derived from the
              literature. RESULTS: When cancer prevalence was 65\%, tissue
              acquisition strategies of NB and CT-FNA had higher
              quality-adjusted life years compared with either FDG-PET or VATS,
              and VATS was the most costly strategy. In sensitivity analyses,
              NB and CT-FNA were more cost-effective than FDG-PET when FDG-PET
              specificity was less than 72\%. When cancer prevalence was 50\%,
              NB, CT-FNA, and FDG-PET had similar cost-effectiveness.
              CONCLUSIONS: Both NB and CT-FNA diagnostic strategies are more
              cost-effective than either VATS biopsy or FDG-PET scan to
              diagnose lung cancer in moderate- to high-risk nodules and
              resulted in fewer nontherapeutic operations when FDG-PET
              specificity was less than 72\%. An FDG-PET scan for diagnosis of

              proximity of peripheral lesions prior to biopsy. This study was
              performed to assess the reach of a robotic endoscopic system
              within human cadaveric lungs compared to conventional thin
              bronchoscopes. DESCRIPTION: All segmental bronchi (RB1-10,
              LB1-10) were accessed in two human cadavers using a conventional
              thin bronchoscope and robotic endoscope of identical outer
              diameter. Bronchus generation count and insertion depth measured
              by electromagnetic navigation and external fluoroscopy were
              recorded. EVALUATION: The robotic endoscope was advanced beyond
              the conventional thin bronchoscope in all segments, particularly
              in bronchi with increased angulation such as RB1 (mean generation
              count 8 vs. 3.5, respectively) and LB1+2 (mean generation count 8

              diameter into the periphery of human cadaveric lungs. Improved

              neurobiological underpinnings of impulsive aggression and to help
              account for its connections with these other disorders, this
              paper reviews relevant biochemical, brain imaging, and genetic
              studies. The review suggests that dysfunctional interactions
              between serotonin and dopamine systems in the prefrontal cortex
              may be an important mechanism underlying the link between
              impulsive aggression and its comorbid disorders. Specifically,
              serotonin hypofunction may represent a biochemical trait that
              predisposes individuals to impulsive aggression, with dopamine
              hyperfunction contributing in an additive fashion to the

              diathesis-stress model of impulsive aggression in which the
              underlying biological diathesis may be deficient serotonergic
              function in the ventral prefrontal cortex. This underlying

              aggression towards oneself and others, and as depression under

              with 10 mg/kg fluoxetine for 12-23 days. In the first experiment,
              body weight and vaginal smears were monitored daily. Fluoxetine
              treatment reduced body weight within the first 24 h of treatment.
              Fluoxetine treatment also elongated the estrous cycle, reduced
              blood levels of progesterone, and eliminated lordosis behavior.
              In the second experiment, body weight and food intake were
              examined and a pair-fed group was included to determine if
              fluoxetine-induced anorexia contributed to the disturbance of the
              estrous cycle. In pair-fed rats, effects similar to fluoxetine
              treatment were present. These results lead to the suggestion that
              fluoxetine's anorectic properties could disrupt the female's
              normal endocrine cyclicity and that this disruption could be
              relevant to the reduction in sexual behavior and motivation.
              However, when the duration of fluoxetine treatment was extended
              beyond 16 to 17 days, fluoxetine-treated female rats reinitiated
              vaginal cyclicity and showed evidence of normal sexual
              receptivity. In contrast, the estrous cycles of their pair-fed
              counterparts remained disrupted. Thus, restricted food intake
              appears to contribute to the disruption of the estrous cycle and
              elimination of sexual receptivity during fluoxetine treatment.
              However, compensatory changes in the serotonergic system that are
              associated with chronic fluoxetine administration may contribute
              to the gradual recovery of estrous cyclicity and sexual

              negatively impacted by inaccurate lesion measurement and
              inappropriate stent length selection (SLS). We compared visual
              estimate of these parameters to those provided by the CorPath
              200\textregistered{} Robotic PCI System. METHODS: Sixty
              consecutive patients who underwent coronary stent placement
              utilizing the CorPath System were evaluated. The treating
              physician assessed orthogonal images and provided visual
              estimates of lesion length and SLS. The robotic system was then
              used for the same measures. SLS was considered to be accurate
              when visual estimate and robotic measures were in agreement.
              Visual estimate SLSs were considered to be ``short'' or ``long''
              if they were below or above the robotic-selected stents,
              respectively. RESULTS: Only 35\% (21/60) of visually estimated
              lesions resulted in accurate SLS, whereas 33\% (20/60) and 32\%
              (19/60) of the visually estimated SLSs were long and short,
              respectively. In 5 cases (8.3\%), 1 less stent was placed based
              on the robotic lesion measurement being shorter than the visual
              estimate. CONCLUSIONS: Visual estimate assessment of lesion
              length and SLS is highly variable with 65\% of the cases being
              inaccurately measured when compared to objective measures
              obtained from the robotic system. The 32\% of the cases where
              lesions were visually estimated to be short represents cases that
              often require the use of extra stents after the full lesion is
              not covered by 1 stent [longitudinal geographic miss (LGM)].
              Further, these data showed that the use of the robotic system
              prevented the use of extra stents in 8.3\% of the cases.

              METHODS: Real-time radiation exposure data were prospectively
              collected from dosimeters worn by operating physicians at the
              head- and chest-level during consecutive PCI cases. Exposures

              lead. RESULTS: Among 336 cases (86.6\% manual, 13.4\% robotic)
              performed over 30weeks, use of suspended lead during manual PCI
              was associated with significantly less radiation exposure to the

              manual assistance or manual conversion during R-PCI in clinical
              practice. METHODS: The CorPath 200 System (Corindus, Waltham, MA)
              enables the operator to sit in a radiation-shielded cockpit and
              remotely control intracoronary devices including guidewires,
              balloons, and stents. Consecutive R-PCI procedures performed over
              18months were analyzed to identify reasons for planned or
              unplanned manual assistance or manual conversion, and categorized
              as due to 1) adverse event; 2) technical limitation of the
              robotic platform; or 3) limited guide catheter/wire support.
              RESULTS: During the study period, 108 R-PCI procedures
              (68.1$\pm$11.0years, 77.8\% men, 69.4\% elective PCI, 78.3\% type
              B2/C lesions, and 50.3\% left anterior descending/left main

              success (91.7\%) and clinical procedural success (99.1\%) were
              achieved. Twenty procedures (18.5\%) required either planned
              partial manual assistance (3.7\%), unplanned partial manual
              assistance (7.4\%), or manual conversion (7.4\%). Among these
              procedures, manual assistance/conversion was required in 3

              success with R-PCI for a complex lesion cohort is possible with
              only occasional partial manual assistance or manual conversion.
              The majority of procedures requiring manual assistance/conversion

              IP fellowships have increased substantially in number from five

              increasingly used for diagnosing pulmonary lesions. Reported
              yield from these procedures varies widely with few randomized
              clinical trials. This study compares the diagnostic yield of a
              thin bronchoscope and radial endobronchial ultrasound (R-EBUS) to
              standard bronchoscopy with fluoroscopy (SB-F) in lung lesions.
              METHODS: Patients presenting for diagnostic bronchoscopic
              evaluation at five centers were randomized to undergo SB-F or
              R-EBUS with thin bronchoscope (TB-EBUS). If SB-F was
              non-diagnostic, cross over to TB-EBUS arm was allowed. Patient
              demographics, radiographic features, and final pathologic or
              radiographic follow-up were collected. Statistical comparisons
              were made using Fisher square, chi-square tests and t-test.
              Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine
              predictors of diagnostic yield. RESULTS: A total of 197 patients
              were included in the final analyses. There was no difference in
              demographics, lesion size, or location between study arms. The
              average lesion size was 31.2mm (SD 10.8mm). Bronchoscopy was
              diagnostic in 44\% (n=87) of cases. Although the diagnostic yield
              was higher in the TB-EBUS arm when compared to the SB-F arm (49\%
              vs 37\%), this difference was not statistically significant
              (p=0.11). Among those with non-diagnostic bronchoscopic findings
              in the standard arm, 87\% (n=46) crossed over to TB-EBUS,
              resulting in a diagnosis in 7 (15\% of 46) additional patients.
              CONCLUSIONS: Bronchoscopy with or without a thin scope and R-EBUS
              had a poor diagnostic yield for pulmonary lesions. Future work
              should focus on improvements in technique and technology advances
              that ensure a higher likelihood of obtaining a diagnosis.",

              valvular heart disease is estimated at 2.5\%. Because of the
              predominance of degenerative etiologies, the prevalence of
              valvular disease increases markedly after the age of 65 years, in
              particular with regard to aortic stenosis and mitral
              regurgitation, which accounts for 3 in 4 cases of valvular
              disease. Rheumatic heart disease still represents 22\% of
              valvular heart disease in Europe. The prevalence of secondary
              mitral regurgitation cannot be assessed reliably but it seems to
              be a frequent disease. The incidence of infective endocarditis is
              approximately 30 cases per million individiuals per year. Its
              stability is associated with marked changes in its presentation.
              Patients are getting older and staphylococcus is now becoming the

              rheumatic heart disease remains the leading cause of valvular

              cardiovascular event risk, mortality, and quality of life have
              been well established by clinical trial data. However, it has
              been a challenge to quantify the relationship between adherence
              and outcomes such as glycemic control, disease-related events,
              hospitalizations, cost, and quality of life. Objective This
              article provides a comprehensive summary of empirical studies
              that examine the associations between adherence and glycemic
              control, health care utilization, quality of life, and mortality
              in patients with diabetes. It is intended to provide a framework
              for researchers interested in conducting studies to improve their
              understanding of the value of medication adherence for patients
              with diabetes. Methods Relevant published articles were
              identified through searches of the National Center for
              Biotechnology PubMed database. Medical subject heading (MESH)
              terms diabetes mellitus, hypoglycemic agents, and insulin, were
              each combined with the MESH term medication adherence and with
              the subheadings economics, prevention and control, psychology,
              statistics and numerical data, therapy, adverse effects,
              therapeutic use, and administration and dosage, where available.
              Studies were included if they met the following criteria: (1)
              analyzed empirical data on some measure of patient adherence to
              diabetes pharmacotherapy; (2) described methods for measuring
              patient adherence; (3) evaluated economic, clinical, or
              humanistic outcomes related to diabetes; and (4) had as a goal of
              the research to evaluate the link between patient adherence and
              outcomes (as a primary or secondary objective). The data from the
              articles meeting these criteria were then abstracted, including
              mention of the specific interventions being compared, specific
              methods for measuring adherence, outcomes compared between
              adherent and nonadherent patients and how these outcomes were
              measured, and information on variables that were adjusted for in
              predictive and causal multivariable models. Results A total of 37
              articles that met all 4 criteria in this review underwent data
              extraction. Of these studies, 22 (59\%) used objective measures
              to assess adherence, with 1 study using pill counts to assess
              adherence and 21 using either pharmacy claims or similar refill
              records to assess refill behavior. The remaining 15 (41\%)
              studies used a wide variety of subjective patient-reported
              adherence assessments. The majority (13/23 [57\%]) of the
              glycemic control studies reported that improved adherence was
              associated with better glycemic control. The ability to draw a
              distinction between adherence and glycemic control tended to
              occur more frequently [7/9 (78\%)] among studies that
              characterized adherence in terms of prescription refills compared
              with studies that used various constructs for patient-reported
              adherence measures. Conclusions Based on the literature, better
              adherence was found to be associated with improved glycemic
              control and decreased health care resource utilization. There was
              no consistent association between improved adherence and

              using the 5\% Medicare claims data (January 1, 2009, to December
              31, 2011) was conducted. Patients aged 65 to 74 years with an
              abnormal chest CT scan were identified. Index was defined as the
              date of the abnormal chest CT scan. Outcomes assessed over a

              rate and the use and associated costs of follow-up diagnostic
              tests up to diagnosis of lung cancer. RESULTS: Of 8979 patients
              identified with an abnormal chest CT scan (mean age, 69.3 $\pm$
              2.9 years), 13.9\% were diagnosed with lung cancer over 12
              months. Chest x-rays were the most common diagnostic test. Of the

              Improving the awareness of the risk of lung cancer and warning
              symptoms, recognition and prompt referral, and screening with low
              dose computed tomography (LDCT) are potential ways to improve

              Seventy-eight patients with histopathologically confirmed GISTs

              unenhanced and contrast-enhanced CT images, respectively.
              Fourteen CT texture parameters were obtained and compared among
              GISTs at different malignancy risks with one-way analysis of
              variance or independent-samples Kruskal-Wallis test. Correlations
              between CT texture parameters and malignancy risk were analysed
              with Spearman's correlation test. Diagnostic performance of CT
              texture parameters in differentiating GISTs at low/very low
              malignancy risk was tested with receiver operating characteristic
              (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: Three parameters on unenhanced images
              (r=-0.268-0.506), four parameters on arterial phase
              (r=-0.365-0.508), and six parameters on venous phase

              is the most effective method for detecting lymph node metastases.
              However, a decline in the rate of PLND during radical
              prostatectomy (RP) has been noted. This is likely the result of
              prostate cancer stage migration in the prostate-specific
              antigen-screening era, and the introduction of minimally invasive
              approaches such as robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).
              OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy, limitations, and complications
              of PLND during RARP. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A review of the
              literature was performed using the Medline, Scopus, and Web of
              Science databases with no restriction of language from January
              1990 to December 2012. The literature search used the following
              terms: prostate cancer, radical prostatectomy, robot-assisted,
              and lymph node dissection. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The median value
              of nodal yield at PLND during RARP ranged from 3 to 24 nodes. As
              seen in open and laparoscopic RP series, the lymph node
              positivity rate increased with the extent of dissection during
              RARP. Overall, PLND-only related complications are rare. The most
              frequent complication after PLND is symptomatic pelvic
              lymphocele, with occurrence ranging from 0\% to 8\% of cases. The
              rate of PLND-associated grade 3-4 complications ranged from 0\%
              to 5\%. PLND is associated with increased operative time.
              Available data suggest equivalence of PLND between RARP and other
              surgical approaches in terms of nodal yield, node positivity, and
              intraoperative and postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: PLND
              during RARP can be performed effectively and safely. The overall
              number of nodes removed, the likelihood of node positivity, and
              the types and rates of complications of PLND are similar to pure
              laparoscopic and open retropubic procedures.",

              compared the HIS with three tools that reflect its key areas:
              physical impact (Pregnancy Unique Quantification of Emesis--PUQE
              score and markers of severity of HG), psychological impact
              (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score--HADS) and social impact

              PARTICIPANTS: The HIS was evaluated on 50 women admitted to
              hospital with HG and 50 women recruited from ante-natal clinic
              without severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and with an
              uncomplicated pregnancy. RESULTS: Good criterion validity was
              demonstrated by strong significant correlations with all three

              boost in the treatment of esophageal cancer with external beam
              radiation therapy (ERT) with or without chemotherapy. METHODS AND
              MATERIALS: Patients without evidence of metastatic disease were
              identified. HDRBT was given before ERT with a dose of 20 Gy in 5
              fractions. Patients with a Karnofsky performance of more than 70
              received treatment with 50 Gy in 25 fractions and concurrent
              5-fluorouracil and cis-platinum during Weeks 1 and 5, whereas
              patients with a Karnofsky performance of less than 70 were
              treated with radiation therapy alone with 35 Gy in 14 fractions.
              RESULTS: Fifty-three patients received HDRBT treatment with
              combined ERT and chemotherapy and 17 patients with ERT alone. The
              incidence of acute bone marrow toxicity was 55\% Grade 2 and 15\%
              Grade 3, and 85\% of patients had Grade 2 esophagitis. With a
              median follow-up time of 26 months, the median survival was 21
              months; the 2-year local recurrence was 25\%, and the 5-year
              survival rate was 28\%. CONCLUSION: HDRBT is safe and beneficial
              for local control in the radical treatment of patients with
              esophageal cancer.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to assess the feasibility and
              safety of a Remote Navigation System (RNS, NaviCath, Haifa,
              Israel) in which the angioplasty guidewire, the balloon, and the
              stent are navigated via a computerized system. BACKGROUND:
              Percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) are manually performed
              under fluoroscopic guidance, requiring lead protection for the
              operators. A system in which the operator can remotely, safely,
              and precisely navigate the procedure during PCI would have clear
              advantages. METHODS: The RNS involves a computer-controlled wire
              and delivery system navigator. Following preclinical validation,
              the system was assessed in patients undergoing single-vessel PCI.
              RESULTS: The study involved 18 patients (age 55.9 years, 16\%
              women). The RNS successfully crossed lesions with the guidewire
              in 17 patients. The stent was then advanced by the advance/rotate
              mode and adequately positioned in 15 of 17 cases. Technical
              malfunction was encountered in three patients in whom the
              procedure was successfully completed manually. Direct stenting
              was employed in 10 of 18 patients, pre-dilation in 7 patients,
              and after-stent balloon dilation in 5 patients. The total
              fluoroscopy time for 17 RNS patients was compared with the
              corresponding time of 20 consecutive patients who underwent
              standard single-lesion PCI. Fluoroscopy time was similar for both
              procedures, with 8.8 +/- 4.8 min with the RNS versus 9.1 +/- 3.5
              min with the standard techniques (p = NS). Clinical success was
              100\% and technical success 94\% for the guidewire and 83\% for
              the overall procedure. CONCLUSIONS: The use of the RNS for
              guidewire, balloon, and stent manipulation during PCI appears
              safe and feasible for the treatment of patients with coronary
              stenosis. The system offers operator radiation safety and may

              practice, and their prevalence is predicted to increase.
              Management of the asymptomatic patient remains controversial.
              Biomarkers have been shown to have utility in the management of
              cardiovascular disease such as heart failure and acute coronary

              natriuretic peptides correlate with measures of disease severity
              and symptomatic status and also can be used to predict outcome.
              This review shows that natriuretic peptides have much promise as
              biomarkers in common valvular heart disease, but the impact of
              their measurement on clinical practice and outcomes needs to be

              robotic-assisted percutaneous coronary intervention. BACKGROUND:
              Robotic systems have been suggested to enhance the performance of
              cardiovascular procedures, as well as to provide protection from
              the occupational hazards that are associated with interventional
              practice. METHODS: Patients with coronary artery disease and
              clinical indications for percutaneous intervention were enrolled.
              The coronary intervention was performed with the CorPath 200
              robotic system, which consists of a remote interventional cockpit
              and a bedside disposable cassette that enables the operator to
              advance, retract, and rotate guidewires and catheters. The
              primary endpoints were clinical procedural success, defined as
              <30\% residual stenosis at the completion of the robotic-assisted
              procedure without major adverse cardiovascular events within 30
              days, and device technical success, defined as the successful
              manipulation of the intracoronary devices using the robotic
              system only. RESULTS: A total of 164 patients were enrolled at 9
              sites. Percutaneous coronary intervention was completed
              successfully without conversion to manual operation, and device
              technical success was achieved in 162 of 164 patients (98.8\%).
              There were no device-related complications. Clinical procedural
              success was achieved in 160 of 164 patients (97.6\%), whereas 4
              (2.4\%) had periprocedural non-Q-wave myocardial infarctions. No
              deaths, strokes, Q-wave myocardial infarctions, or
              revascularization occurred in the 30 days after the procedures.
              Radiation exposure for the primary operator was 95.2\% lower than
              the levels found at the traditional table position. CONCLUSIONS:
              This pivotal multicenter study with a robotic-enhanced coronary
              intervention system demonstrated the safety and feasibility of
              the system. The robotic remote-control procedure met the expected

              intraperitoneal mesh placement (LapIPOM) for minimally invasive
              incisional hernia repair. We aimed to compare LapIPOM with rIPOM
              in terms of hospital length of stay (LOS) and 30-day
              postoperative complications in patients undergoing incisional
              hernia repair within the Americas Hernia Society Quality
              Collaborative. STUDY DESIGN: Propensity score analysis was used
              to compare matched groups of patients within the Americas Hernia
              Society Quality Collaborative undergoing LapIPOM vs rIPOM. The
              primary outcomes measure was hospital LOS and secondary outcomes
              were 30-day wound events. RESULTS: Four hundred and fifty-four
              (71.9\%) patients underwent LapIPOM and 177 (28.1\%) underwent
              rIPOM. The laparoscopic group had an increased median LOS (1 vs 0
              days; interquartile range 3.00; p < 0.001). The risk of surgical
              site occurrence was higher in the LapIPOM group vs the rIPOM
              group (14\% vs 5\%; p = 0.001); however, surgical site occurrence
              requiring procedural intervention was similar between the groups
              (1\% vs 0\%; p = 1). Operative time longer than 2 hours was more
              common in the rIPOM group (47\% vs 31\%; p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS:
              Despite longer operative times using the rIPOM approach, patients
              undergoing rIPOM had a significantly shorter LOS than LapIPOM,
              without additional risk of wound morbidity requiring
              intervention. Additional studies are necessary to identify the
              best candidates for the rIPOM approach.",

              robotic angioplasty system in delivery and manipulation of
              coronary guidewires, balloons, and stents in patients undergoing
              elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). BACKGROUND: A
              remote-control, robotic-assisted angioplasty system is under
              development to address some of the procedural challenges and
              occupational hazards associated with traditional PCI. METHODS:
              Patients with coronary artery disease and clinical indication for
              elective PCI were enrolled. The coronary angioplasty procedure
              was performed with the CorPath 200 robotic system (Corindus,
              Inc., Natick, Massachusetts). The system consists of a remote
              interventional cockpit and a multicomponent bedside unit that
              enables the operator to advance, retract, and rotate guidewires
              and rapid exchange catheters. The primary endpoint was device
              clinical success ($\leq$ 30\% residual stenosis) without
              in-hospital major adverse cardiac events. Technical success was
              defined as the ability of the system to complete all the planned
              angioplasty steps on the basis of procedural segments. Patients
              were followed up to 30 days after angioplasty procedure. RESULTS:
              A total of 8 patients were enrolled in the study. The primary
              endpoint was achieved in all patients (100\%). The technical
              success of the robotic system was 97.9\% in completing 47 of 48
              planned steps. There were no device- or procedure-related
              complications and no in-hospital or 30-day major adverse cardiac
              events. The operators rated the robotic system performances as
              equal to or better than manual procedures in 97.5\% of the cases.
              The operator radiation exposure was 97\% lower than the levels
              found at the standard table position. CONCLUSIONS: Early clinical
              experience with a robotic-assisted angioplasty system
              demonstrated feasibility, safety, and procedural effectiveness
              comparable to manual operation. In addition, the total operator
              exposure to radiation was significantly low. A larger study is

              of R-PCI compared with manual percutaneous coronary intervention

              coronary lesions. The utility of R-PCI for complex coronary
              lesions is unknown. METHODS: All consecutive PCI procedures
              performed robotically (study group) or manually (control group)
              over 18 months were included. R-PCI technical success, defined as
              the completion of the procedure robotically or with partial
              manual assistance and without a major adverse cardiovascular
              event, was determined. Procedures ineligible for R-PCI (i.e.,
              atherectomy, planned 2-stent strategy for bifurcation lesion,
              chronic total occlusion requiring hybrid approach) were excluded
              for analysis from the M-PCI group. Clinical success, defined as
              completion of the PCI procedure without a major adverse
              cardiovascular event, procedure time, stent use, and fluoroscopy
              time were compared between groups. RESULTS: A total of 315
              patients (mean age 67.7 $\pm$ 11.8 years; 78\% men) underwent 334
              PCI procedures (108 R-PCIs, 157 lesions, 78.3\% type B2/C; 226
              M-PCIs, 336 lesions, 68.8\% type B2/C). Technical success with
              R-PCI was 91.7\% (rate of manual assistance 11.1\%, rate of
              manual conversion 7.4\%, rate of major adverse cardiovascular
              events 0.93\%). Clinical success (99.1\% with R-PCI vs. 99.1\%
              with M-PCI; p = 1.00), stent use (stents per procedure 1.59 $\pm$
              0.79 with R-PCI vs. 1.54 $\pm$ 0.75 with M-PCI; p = 0.73), and
              fluoroscopy time (18.2 $\pm$ 10.4 min with R-PCI vs. 19.2 $\pm$
              11.4 min with M-PCI; p = 0.39) were similar between the groups,
              although procedure time was longer in the R-PCI group (44:30
              $\pm$ 26:04 min:s vs. 36:34 $\pm$ 23:03 min:s; p = 0.002).
              Propensity-matched analysis confirmed that procedure time was
              longer in the robotic group (42:59 $\pm$ 26:14 min:s with R-PCI
              vs. 34:01 $\pm$ 17:14 min:s with M-PCI; p = 0.007), although
              clinical success remained similar (98.8\% with R-PCI vs. 100\%
              with M-PCI; p = 1.00). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the
              feasibility, safety, and high technical success of R-PCI for the
              treatment of complex coronary disease. Furthermore, comparable
              clinical outcomes, without an adverse effect on stent use or
              fluoroscopy time, were observed with R-PCI and M-PCI.",

              Prospective, randomized controlled trial. Setting Academic
              medical center. Patients Sixty-five adult patients scheduled for
              elective surgery requiring general anesthesia. Interventions
              Patients were randomized into 2 groups. Group A (n = 33) were
              intubated using Ambu Aura-i and the Ambu aScope 2, a disposable
              flexible intubating scope, whereas those in group B (n = 33) were
              blindly intubated using the Intubating Laryngeal Mask Airway
              (ILMA). Measurements First-attempt intubation success rate,
              overall intubation success rate, time to intubation, incidence of
              airway morbidity. Main results The data demonstrated that time
              for endotracheal intubation in the ILMA group was significantly
              shorter than in the Ambu Aura-i group (P < .05). There was no
              difference in the first-attempt intubation success rate (Aura-i =
              26/33, 78.8\%; ILMA = 27/33, 81.8\%; P = .757) or the overall
              intubation success rate (Aura-i = 29/33, 87.9\%; ILMA = 31/33,
              93.9\%; P = .392) between the groups. Four patients (12\%) in the
              Ambu Aura-i group had a failed intubation; 1 was due to a failure
              of the aScope monitor, whereas 3 were due to inability to
              visualize the glottis. Two patients (7\%) in the ILMA group had a
              failed intubation due to esophageal intubation. There was no
              statistically significant difference in airway morbidity between
              the 2 groups. Conclusions The data suggest that intubation with
              the ILMA is faster but that first-attempt and overall intubation
              success rates were comparable in both groups. The results suggest
              that although the flexible intubating scope--guided Aura-i does
              not outperform blind intubation via the ILMA, the technique is

              Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, and the Association for
              Molecular Pathology to set standards for the molecular analysis
              of lung cancers to guide treatment decisions with targeted
              inhibitors. New evidence has prompted an evaluation of additional
              laboratory technologies, targetable genes, patient populations,
              and tumor types for testing. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review
              and update the 2013 guideline to affirm its validity; to assess
              the evidence of new genetic discoveries, technologies, and
              therapies; and to issue an evidence-based update. DESIGN: The
              College of American Pathologists, the International Association
              for the Study of Lung Cancer, and the Association for Molecular
              Pathology convened an expert panel to develop an evidence-based
              guideline to help define the key questions and literature search
              terms, review abstracts and full articles, and draft
              recommendations. RESULTS: Eighteen new recommendations were
              drafted. The panel also updated 3 recommendations from the 2013
              guideline. CONCLUSIONS: The 2013 guideline was largely reaffirmed
              with updated recommendations to allow testing of cytology
              samples, require improved assay sensitivity, and recommend
              against the use of immunohistochemistry for EGFR testing. Key new
              recommendations include ROS1 testing for all adenocarcinoma
              patients; the inclusion of additional genes (ERBB2, MET, BRAF,

              impact: accommodation and burden. The current study describes the
              scale's development and preliminary validation. Methods One
              hundred thirty-four adults, identifying as the relative of
              someone with problematic hoarding (n=102) or normative collecting
              behavior (n=32), completed the FISH alongside measures of
              hoarding severity, burden, functional impairment, and quality of
              life (QoL). Exploratory factor analysis (FA) was used to examine
              the scale's factor structure. Internal consistency, known-groups
              and convergent validity were also investigated. Results FA
              supported two factors, accounting for 65.43\% of variance. Of the
              scale items, 16 were determined to load onto these factors. Items
              that did not load were omitted. The revised scale accounted for
              67.41\% of variance and was characterized by good internal
              consistency ($\alpha$=0.86). This measure also differentiated
              between study groups and demonstrated strong correlations with
              measures of severity and burden. Regression indicated the FISH
              better predicted group membership than existing measures of
              burden, impairment or quality of life. Discussion The FISH is a
              promising measure of family impact in the context of (HD). Its
              psychometric properties and utility in monitoring outcomes of
              caregiver-based interventions should be investigated further.",

               pediatric obsessive--compulsive disorder (OCD), with a large
               number of families engaging in behaviors and modifying family
               routines in response to the youth's OCD symptoms. Family
               accommodation is commonly considered as a unidimensional
               construct, resulting in limited research on the phenomenological
               aspects of family accommodation and how different facets (i.e.,
               participation, modification, and distress/consequences) may
               impact pediatric OCD. As such, the present study sought to
               examine the extent to which family accommodation, as a whole and
               within subtypes, was related to OCD symptom severity and symptom
               dimensions, youth clinical characteristics (i.e.,
               internalizing/externalizing symptoms, depressive symptoms), and
               family factors (i.e., cohesion and conflict). Family
               accommodation was related to OCD symptom severity and the
               contamination symptom dimension, youth depressive symptoms (but
               not the participation domain), and youth
               internalizing/externalizing symptoms. Youth externalizing
               symptoms mediated the relationship between OCD symptom severity
               and family accommodation. After controlling for OCD symptom
               severity, youth externalizing symptoms predicted family
               accommodation in general, as well as the distress/consequences
               domain. Family cohesion predicted participation in OCD symptoms,
               above and beyond OCD symptom severity. Detailed results and

               dysfunction and burden on family members. Currently, little is
               known about the effect that family members have on individuals'
               hoarding symptoms and functioning, and vice versa. The present
               study examined the nature and frequency of accommodation in
               hoarding. Fifty-two individuals with self-reported hoarding
               problems and their close significant others (CSOs) completed the
               Family Accommodation Interview for Hoarding (FAI-H), which was
               adapted from a previously validated measure for this study, and
               a series of self-report questionnaires. The FAI-H was found to
               be a reliable and valid measure of accommodation in problem
               hoarding. CSOs who lived with the individual with the hoarding
               problem reported engaging in accommodating behaviors more
               frequently than those who did not live with the individual.
               Accommodation was positively associated with hoarding symptom
               severity, relationship functioning, and CSOs' rejecting
               attitudes toward the individual with hoarding problems, and it
               partially mediated the association between hoarding symptom
               severity and relationship conflict. These results inform our
               understanding of accommodation and interpersonal processes in

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer risk prediction models have the
              potential to make programs more affordable; however, the economic
              evidence is limited. METHODS: Participants in the National Lung
              Cancer Screening Trial (NLST) were retrospectively identified
              with the risk prediction tool developed from the Prostate, Lung,
              Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. The high-risk
              subgroup was assessed for lung cancer incidence and demographic
              characteristics compared with those in the low-risk subgroup and
              the Pan-Canadian Early Detection of Lung Cancer Study (PanCan),
              which is an observational study that was high-risk-selected in
              Canada. A comparison of high-risk screening versus standard care
              was made with a decision-analytic model using data from the NLST
              with Canadian cost data from screening and treatment in the
              PanCan study. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity
              analyses were undertaken to assess uncertainty and identify
              drivers of program efficiency. RESULTS: Use of the risk
              prediction tool developed from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and
              Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial with a threshold set at 2\% over 6
              years would have reduced the number of individuals who needed to
              be screened in the NLST by 81\%. High-risk screening participants
              in the NLST had more adverse demographic characteristics than
              their counterparts in the PanCan study. High-risk screening would
              cost $20,724 (in 2015 Canadian dollars) per quality-adjusted
              life-year gained and would be considered cost-effective at a
              willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 in Canadian dollars per
              quality-adjusted life-year gained with a probability of 0.62.
              Cost-effectiveness was driven primarily by non-lung cancer
              outcomes. Higher noncurative drug costs or current costs for
              immunotherapy and targeted therapies in the United States would
              render lung cancer screening a cost-saving intervention.
              CONCLUSIONS: Non-lung cancer outcomes drive screening efficiency
              in diverse, tobacco-exposed populations. Use of risk selection
              can reduce the budget impact, and screening may even offer cost
              savings if noncurative treatment costs continue to rise.",

              lack of real-time three-dimensional (3D) localization and
              position updating: they are still navigated based on
              two-dimensional (2D) X-ray fluoroscopic projection images. Our
              goal was to evaluate whether incorporating an electromagnetic
              (EM) sensor on a robotic catheter tip could improve endovascular
              navigation. METHODS: Six users were tasked to navigate using a
              robotic catheter with incorporated EM sensors in an aortic
              aneurysm phantom. All users cannulated two anatomic targets (left
              renal artery and posterior ``gate'') using four visualization
              modes: (1) standard fluoroscopy mode (control), (2) 2D
              fluoroscopy mode showing real-time virtual catheter orientation
              from EM tracking, (3) 3D model of the phantom with
              anteroposterior and endoluminal view, and (4) 3D model with
              anteroposterior and lateral view. Standard X-ray fluoroscopy was
              always available. Cannulation and fluoroscopy times were noted
              for every mode. 3D positions of the EM tip sensor were recorded
              at 4 Hz to establish kinematic metrics. RESULTS: The EM
              sensor-incorporated catheter navigated as expected according to
              all users. The success rate for cannulation was 100\%. For the
              posterior gate target, mean cannulation times in minutes:seconds
              were 8:12, 4:19, 4:29, and 3:09, respectively, for modes 1, 2, 3
              and 4 (P = .013), and mean fluoroscopy times were 274, 20, 29,
              and 2 seconds, respectively (P = .001). 3D path lengths, spectral
              arc length, root mean dimensionless jerk, and number of
              submovements were significantly improved when EM tracking was
              used (P < .05), showing higher quality of catheter movement with
              EM navigation. CONCLUSIONS: The EM tracked robotic catheter
              allowed better real-time 3D orientation, facilitating navigation,

              whether this encounter may represent an opportunity to reduce
              tobacco use. METHODS: Ever smokers between the ages of 55 and 80
              and $\geq$1.5\% lung cancer risk over 6 years or having smoked
              $\geq$30 pack-years and with no more than 15 years of smoking
              abstinence were eligible to participate in the Alberta Lung
              Cancer Screening Program (ALCSP). A baseline questionnaire
              exploring tobacco use was administered to all interested
              individuals as part of the eligibility determination for the
              program. RESULTS: Among 504 individuals, 254 (50.4\%) met the
              criteria for the ALCSP and 250 (49.6\%) were non-eligible for
              screening. Non-eligible individuals were slightly younger
              (mean=60.2 vs. 63.1 years, p-value <0.001), and less likely to be
              current smokers (26.0\% vs. 48.8\%, p-value <0.001). Non-eligible
              smokers had a lower degree of addiction compared to eligible
              group, as measured by the Fagerstr{\"o}m Test of Nicotine
              Dependence (Median=4.0 vs 6.0, p-value=0.001), but still in the
              ``moderately dependent'' range for this test. There were no
              significant differences in motivation to quit (98.5\% vs. 97.6\%,
              p-value=0.689), or motivation to receive help with their quit
              attempt (89.2\% vs. 90.3\%, p-value=0.813) between these two
              groups. Only 7.7\% of non-eligible and 2.4\% of eligible current
              smokers were currently in a smoking cessation program.
              CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of individuals applying to,
              but not qualifying for a lung cancer screening program are active
              smokers with significant nicotine dependence. Very few are
              currently participating in active smoking cessation programs but
              almost all are interested in quitting and in receiving help with
              quit attempts. Future studies need to investigate the most
              effective approaches for smoking cessation in this substantial
              group of older, long-term smokers, capitalizing on their
              motivation to receive cessation assistance.",

              introduce a method for learning image features with locally
              connected layers in SNNs using a spike-timing-dependent
              plasticity (STDP) rule. In our approach, sub-networks compete via
              inhibitory interactions to learn features from different
              locations of the input space. These locally-connected SNNs
              (LC-SNNs) manifest key topological features of the spatial
              interaction of biological neurons. We explore a biologically
              inspired n-gram classification approach allowing parallel
              processing over various patches of the image space. We report the
              classification accuracy of simple two-layer LC-SNNs on two image
              datasets, which respectively match state-of-art performance and
              are the first results to date. LC-SNNs have the advantage of fast
              convergence to a dataset representation, and they require fewer
              learnable parameters than other SNN approaches with unsupervised
              learning. Robustness tests demonstrate that LC-SNNs exhibit
              graceful degradation of performance despite the random deletion

              databases were searched for PA intervention studies in primary
              care settings. RESULTS: Of the 19 studies, 37\% were conducted
              solely by physicians, 37\% by allied health professionals, while
              26\% were combined-provider interventions. There was a decline in

              students who had attempted to intubate 19,108 patients. This
              review shows that in mostly elective circumstances, at least 50
              ETIs with no more than two intubation attempts need to be
              performed to reach a success rate of at least 90\%. However, the
              evidence is heterogeneous, and the incidence of difficult airways
              in non-elective settings is up to 20 times higher compared to
              elective settings. Taking this factor into account, training
              should include a variety of exposures and should probably exceed
              50 ETIs to successfully serve the most vulnerable patients.",

              with both RFA and SRS demonstrating similar early response and
              progression rates. RFA can be performed in one treatment session,
              whereas it now seems that SRS is more effective if larger doses
              of radiation over two to three fractions are performed. RFA is
              not recommended for centrally based tumors. There are also some
              tumors (eg, small apical tumors, posteriorly positioned tumors
              close to the diaphragm, and tumors close to the scapula) where it
              may be difficult percutaneously to position an active electrode.
              Such patients are more optimally treated with SRS. In certain
              circumstances, a combined approach may be beneficial (RFA and
              SRS). At this point in time, MWA is the least well developed

              METHODS: Between 2006 and 2015, the clipping of 115 intracranial
              aneurysms in 105 patients was preoperatively planned with the
              Dextroscope, a stereoscopic, patient-specific VR environment. The

              aneurysms in 77 patients were electively planned and treated
              surgically. Mortality was 0\% and morbidity (modified Rankin

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: In endovascular embolization for intracranial
              aneurysms, it is important to properly control the coil insertion
              force. However, the force can only be subjectively detected by
              the subtle feedback experienced by neurointerventionists at their
              fingertips. The authors envisioned a system that would
              objectively sense and quantify that force. In this article, coil
              insertion force was measured in cases of intracranial aneurysm
              using this sensor, and its actual clinical application was
              investigated. METHODS: The sensor consists of a hemostatic valve
              (Y-connector). A little flexure was intentionally added in the
              device, and it creates a bend in the delivery wire. The sensor
              measures the change in the position of the bent wire depending on
              the insertion force and translates it into a force value. Using
              this, embolization was performed for 10 unruptured intracranial
              aneurysms. RESULTS: The sensor adequately recorded the force, and
              it reflected the operators' usual clinical experience. The
              presence of the sensor did not affect the procedures. The sensor
              enabled the operators to objectively note and evaluate the
              insertion force and better cooperative handling was possible.
              Additionally, other members of the intervention team shared the
              information. Force records demonstrated the characteristic
              patterns according to every stage of coiling (framing, filling,
              and finishing). CONCLUSIONS: The force sensor system adequately
              measured coil insertion force in intracranial aneurysm coil
              embolization procedures. The safety of this sensor was
              demonstrated in clinical application for the limited number of

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Many retrospective studies of pedicle screw placement
              have revealed that intraoperative navigation systems provide
              higher accuracy rates and safety than do free-hand techniques.
              The accuracy of various image-guided navigation systems has been
              studied; however, differences have not been well defined due to
              the lack of adequate evidence-based comparative studies.
              OBJECTIVE: A meta-analysis was conducted to focus on the
              variation in pedicle screw insertion among 3 navigation systems:
              a 3-dimensional fluoroscopy-based navigation system (3D
              FluoroNav), a 2-dimensional fluoroscopy-based navigation system
              (2D FluoroNav), and a conventional computed tomography navigation
              system (CT Nav). METHODS: We screened for comparative studies on
              different pedicle screw insertion navigation systems published
              through January 2017 using the Cochrane Library, Ovid, Web of
              Science, PubMed, and EMBASE databases. RESULTS: From 125 papers
              that were identified, 10 articles were finally chosen. The
              present comparative study included 8 retrospective clinical
              studies, 1 prospective clinical trial, and 1 randomized
              controlled cadaveric study. The prevalence rate of pedicle
              violation in the 3D FluoroNav group was significantly lower than
              the rates of the 2D FluoroNav group (relative risk [RR] 95\%,
              confidence interval [CI]: 0.16-0.61, P < 0.01) and the CT Nav
              group (RR 95\%, CI: 0.42-0.90, P = 0.01), and the rate of the CT
              Nav group was significantly lower than that of the 2D FluoroNav
              group (RR 95\%, CI: 0.29-0.81, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Significant
              differences exist among CT Nav, 3D FluoroNav, and 2D FluoroNav.
              Our review suggests that 3D FluoroNav may be superior to the
              other 2 methods in reducing pedicle violation and that clinicians
              should consider 3D FluoroNav as a better choice.",

              mapping using cervical injection of patent blue combined with
              filtered 99mTc-SC in the operating room was done. Patients
              underwent robotic-assisted lymphatic mapping with frozen section,
              hysterectomy, BSO, and completion bilateral lymphadenectomy
              (including para-aortic nodes in grade 2 and 3 tumors). RESULTS:
              At least one SLN was detected in 92\% of patients; in 66 of these
              (72\%) bilateral SLN were detected, and in 15 cases the SLN was
              in the para-aortic area. Eleven percent of all patients had lymph
              node metastases, and 4 of which had pre-operative grade 1 tumor.
              The SLN was the only positive node in 44\% of the cases with
              positive nodes. Sensitivity was 89\% with 1 false negative
              result, yielding a negative predictive value of 99\% (95\% CI
              93-100). Specificity was 100\% (95\% CI 94-100), and positive

              patients ($\geq$70years) with endometrial cancer undergoing
              staging procedure with traditional open surgery compared to
              robotic surgery. RESULTS: All consecutive patients $\geq$70years
              of age with endometrial cancer who underwent robotic surgery
              (n=113) were compared with all consecutive patients $\geq$70years
              of age (n=50) before the introduction of a robotic program in
              December 2007. Baseline patient characteristics were similar in
              both eras. Patients undergoing robotic surgery had longer mean
              operating times (244 compared with 217minutes, p=0.009) but fewer
              minor adverse events (17\% compared with 60\%, p<0.001). The
              robotics cohort had less estimated mean blood loss (75 vs 334mL,

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Until recently, hoarding was considered an
               obsessive-compulsive symptom (OCS). However, current evidence
               suggests that these two phenotypes may be clinically, and
               perhaps etiologically, distinct. Both hoarding and OCS have a
               genetic etiology, but the degree of unique and shared genetic
               contributions to these phenotypes has not been well studied.
               METHOD: Prevalence rates were assessed for hoarding and OCS in a
               sample of adult twin pairs (n = 7906 twins) and their family
               members from The Netherlands Twin Register (total sample =
               15,914). Using Mplus, genetic analyses using liability threshold
               models were conducted for both phenotypes, for their
               co-morbidity, and for specific hoarding symptoms (cluttering,
               discarding and acquiring). RESULTS: Of the total sample, 6.7\%
               met criteria for clinically significant hoarding; endorsement of
               all three hoarding symptoms was > or = 79\%. Men had slightly
               higher rates than women. Also, 5.7\% met criteria for clinically
               significant OCS; rates were similar in males and females.
               Genetic factors accounted for 36\% of the variance for hoarding
               and 40\% of the variance for OCS. The genetic correlation
               between hoarding and OCS was 0.10. There was no evidence of
               sex-specific genetic contributions for hoarding or OCS. There
               was evidence for a genetic contribution to all hoarding symptom
               subtypes. Only cluttering showed evidence of a contribution from
               the shared environment. CONCLUSIONS: OCS and hoarding are common
               in this population-based sample, have prevalence rates similar
               to those previously reported, and show significant heritability.
               Genetic factors contributed to the co-morbidity of both traits,

              Against Cancer (CPAC) commissioned the development of a Cancer
              Risk Management Model (CRMM)--a computer microsimulation model
              that simulates individual lives one at a time, from birth to
              death, taking account of Canadian demographic and labor force
              characteristics, risk factor exposures, and health histories.
              Information from all the simulated lives is combined to produce
              aggregate measures of health outcomes for the population or for
              particular subpopulations. RESULTS: The CRMM can project the
              population health and economic impacts of cancer control programs

              prevention, and screening programs and new cancer treatments on

              objectives of this analysis were to calculate costs for the first
              year post-stroke and determine the impact of disability on costs.
              METHODOLOGY: The Economic Burden of Ischemic Stroke (BURST) Study
              was a one-year prospective study with a cohort of ischemic stroke
              patients recruited at 12 Canadian stroke centres. Clinical
              history, disability, health preference and resource utilization
              information was collected at discharge, three months, six months
              and one year. Resources included direct medical costs (2009
              CAN\$) such as emergency services, hospitalizations,
              rehabilitation, physician services, diagnostics, medications,
              allied health professional services, homecare, medical/assistive
              devices, changes to residence and paid caregivers, as well as
              indirect costs. Results were stratified by disability measured at
              discharge using the modified Rankin Score (mRS): non-disabling
              stroke (mRS 0-2) and disabling stroke (mRS 3-5). RESULTS: We
              enrolled 232 ischemic stroke patients (age 69.4 \pm 15.4 years;
              51.3\% male) and 113 (48.7\%) were disabled at hospital
              discharge. The average annual cost was \$74,353; \$107,883 for
              disabling strokes and \$48,339 for non-disabling strokes.
              CONCLUSIONS: An average annual cost for ischemic stroke was
              calculated in which a disabling stroke was associated with a
              two-fold increase in costs compared to NDS. Costs during the
              hospitalization to three months phase were the highest
              contributor to the annual cost. A ``back of the envelope''
              calculation using 38,000 stroke admissions and the average annual
              cost yields \$2.8 billion as the burden of ischemic stroke.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Sometimes the suspicion is put forward that nutrition
              students show more disordered eating patterns, which may be among
              the motivating factors to study nutrition. At the same time, it
              is not clear whether the students' increasing knowledge about
              diet and nutrition is associated with a more healthy eating
              behaviour or with an unhealthy obsession with food choices.
              DESIGN: Cross-sectional comparison of nutrition students from
              German universities during the first year of their studies (n
              123) and during higher semesters (n 96), with a control group
              from other study programmes (n 68 and n 46, respectively).
              Dietary restraint, disinhibition, the tendency towards orthorexia
              nervosa and healthy food choices were assessed using a
              questionnaire. RESULTS: Nutrition students showed higher levels
              of dietary restraint than the control group. Disinhibition and
              orthorexia nervosa did not differ between nutrition students and
              controls. Orthorexic tendencies were lower in the more advanced
              nutrition students. Healthy food choices did not differ among
              students in the first year. More advanced nutrition students
              showed healthier food choices, whereas the corresponding controls
              showed slightly more unhealthy food choices. CONCLUSIONS:
              Nutrition students, more than other students, tend to restrict
              their food intake in order to control their weight, but they do
              not have more disturbed or disordered eating patterns than other
              students. Moreover, during the course of their studies, they
              adopt slightly more healthy food choices and decrease their
              tendency to be obsessive in their eating behaviour.",

              motivate oneself via agentic thinking to initiate and sustain
              movement along those pathways. The roles of these pathways and
              agency components of hope theory are described along with
              similarities and differences relative to other motivational and
              emotional theories, including optimism, self-efficacy,
              self-esteem, and problem solving. The goal focus, agentic
              thought, and pathways thought of hope theory are used as a
              framework for understanding the adaptive processes in the various
              phases of cognitive-behavior therapies, including relapse
              prevention. It is concluded that hope theory offers a valuable
              overarching framework for understanding common factors in
              behavior therapies.",

  abstract  = "RNA has a dual role as an informational molecule and a direct
               effector of biological tasks. The latter function is enabled by
               RNA's ability to adopt complex secondary and tertiary folds and
               thus has motivated extensive computational and experimental
               efforts for determining RNA structures. Existing approaches for
               evaluating RNA structure have been largely limited to in vitro
               systems, yet the thermodynamic forces which drive RNA folding in
               vitro may not be sufficient to predict stable RNA structures in
               vivo. Indeed, the presence of RNA-binding proteins and
               ATP-dependent helicases can influence which structures are
               present inside cells. Here we present an approach for globally
               monitoring RNA structure in native conditions in vivo with
               single-nucleotide precision. This method is based on in vivo
               modification with dimethyl sulphate (DMS), which reacts with
               unpaired adenine and cytosine residues, followed by deep
               sequencing to monitor modifications. Our data from yeast and
               mammalian cells are in excellent agreement with known messenger
               RNA structures and with the high-resolution crystal structure of
               the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosome. Comparison between in
               vivo and in vitro data reveals that in rapidly dividing cells
               there are vastly fewer structured mRNA regions in vivo than in
               vitro. Even thermostable RNA structures are often denatured in
               cells, highlighting the importance of cellular processes in
               regulating RNA structure. Indeed, analysis of mRNA structure
               under ATP-depleted conditions in yeast shows that
               energy-dependent processes strongly contribute to the
               predominantly unfolded state of mRNAs inside cells. Our studies
               broadly enable the functional analysis of physiological RNA
               structures and reveal that, in contrast to the Anfinsen view of
               protein folding whereby the structure formed is the most
               thermodynamically favourable, thermodynamics have an incomplete
               role in determining mRNA structure in vivo.",

              notoriously difficult. Traditional drug development fails to
              exploit knowledge of the psychological factors that crucially
              influence appetite, concentrating instead on restrictive criteria
              of intake and weight reduction, allied to a mechanistic view of
              energy regulation. Drugs are under development that may produce
              beneficial changes in appetite expression in the obese. These
              currently include glucagon-like peptide-1 analogs such as
              liraglutide, an amylin analog davalintide, the 5-HT(2C) receptor
              agonist lorcaserin, the monoamine re-uptake inhibitor
              tesofensine, and a number of combination therapies such as
              pramlintide and metreleptin, bupropion and naltrexone,
              phentermine and topiramate, and bupropion and zonisamide.
              However, the effects of these treatments on eating behavior
              remain poorly characterized. Obesity is typically a consequence
              of overconsumption driven by an individual's natural sensitivity
              to food stimuli and the pleasure derived from eating.
              Intuitively, these processes should be effective targets for
              pharmacotherapy, and behavioral analysis can identify drugs that
              selectively affect desire to eat, enjoyment of eating, satiation
              or postmeal satiety. Rational interventions designed specifically
              to modulate these processes could limit the normally aversive
              consequences of caloric restriction and maximize an individual's
              capacity to successfully gain control over their appetite.",

              involvement of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and orexins in the

              orexin immunostaining in several hypothalamic regions. RESEARCH
              METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Male obese Zucker (fa/fa) rats were
              administered fluoxetine (10 mg/kg intraperitoneally) daily for 2
              weeks. The control group was administered 0.9\% NaCl solution.
              Carcass composition was assessed using the official methods of
              the Association of Official Analytical Chemists. To test the
              potential thermogenic effect of fluoxetine administration, total
              body oxygen consumption was measured daily for 60 minutes before
              fluoxetine or saline injection and for 30 minutes after drug or
              saline injection. Hypothalamic arcuate and paraventricular
              nuclei, and the lateral hypothalamic area were immunostained for
              NPY, orexin A, and orexin B. Commercial kits were used for serum
              determinations. RESULTS: Chronic fluoxetine administration in
              obese Zucker rats generated a reduction in body weight gain, food
              intake, adipocyte size, fat mass, and body protein. A decrease in
              NPY immunostaining in the paraventricular nucleus, without
              changes in the arcuate, was observed. However, no changes were
              observed in the number of neural cells immunostained for orexin A
              or orexin B in the lateral hypothalamic area. DISCUSSION: Due to
              the hyperphagic effect of NPY in the paraventricular nucleus,
              these results suggest that NPY, but not orexins, could be
              involved in the anorexigenic effect of fluoxetine in obese Zucker

              non-pharmaceutical interventions have suppressed the local
              outbreak of this disease1. Here we use a modelling approach to
              reconstruct the full-spectrum dynamics of COVID-19 in Wuhan
              between 1 January and 8 March 2020 across 5 periods defined by
              events and interventions, on the basis of 32,583
              laboratory-confirmed cases1. Accounting for presymptomatic
              infectiousness2, time-varying ascertainment rates, transmission
              rates and population movements3, we identify two key features of
              the outbreak: high covertness and high transmissibility. We
              estimate 87\% (lower bound, 53\%) of the infections before 8
              March 2020 were unascertained (potentially including asymptomatic
              and mildly symptomatic individuals); and a basic reproduction
              number (R0) of 3.54 (95\% credible interval 3.40-3.67) in the
              early outbreak, much higher than that of severe acute respiratory
              syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)4,5.
              We observe that multipronged interventions had considerable
              positive effects on controlling the outbreak, decreasing the
              reproduction number to 0.28 (95\% credible interval 0.23-0.33)
              and-by projection-reducing the total infections in Wuhan by
              96.0\% as of 8 March 2020. We also explore the probability of
              resurgence following the lifting of all interventions after 14
              consecutive days of no ascertained infections; we estimate this
              probability at 0.32 and 0.06 on the basis of models with 87\% and
              53\% unascertained cases, respectively-highlighting the risk
              posed by substantial covert infections under changing control
              measures. These results have important implications when
              considering strategies of continuing surveillance and
              interventions to eventually contain outbreaks of COVID-19.",

              35 kg/m(2) (29-48). INTERVENTION: Two programmes were used. Both
              were based on group therapy and were supervised by a dietitian
              and a psychologist. Group 1 received a continuous intensive
              treatment with planned group meetings every fortnight during the

              The VLCD periods were the same. RESULTS: There was no evidence
              that a more intensive treatment promotes a larger weight
              reduction. Weight reduction after 1 y: group 1, -7.6 (+/-0.97)
              kg, BMI -2.6 (+/-0.3) kg/m(2); group 2, -6.4 (+/-1.16) kg, BMI

              kg, BMI -3.0 (+/-0.3) kg/m(2). The dropout rate was 26\%.
              CONCLUSION: There were no significant differences in weight
              reduction, compliance or dropout rate between the groups and
              there was no evidence that a more intensive treatment promotes a
              larger weight reduction. This observation is of value when

              anthropometrical status during the treatment and to give
              continuous feedback to the subjects seem to be important factors
              for compliance. Both treatment programmes gave highly significant

              the output of a survey involving a cohort of all Italian
              hospitals performing thoracic surgery to gather data on
              anesthetic management, one-lung ventilation (OLV) management, and
              post-thoracotomy pain relief in thoracic anesthesia. DESIGN:
              Survey. SETTING: Italy. PARTICIPANTS: An invitation to
              participate in the survey was e-mailed to all the members of the
              Italian Society of Anesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine.
              INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 62
              responses were received from 47 centers. The key findings were:
              Double-lumen tube is still the first choice lung separation
              technique in current use; pressure-controlled ventilation and
              volume-controlled ventilation modes are homogenously distributed
              across the sample and, a tidal volumes (VT) of 4-6 mL/kg during
              OLV was preferred to all others; moderate or restrictive fluid
              management were the most used strategies of fluid administration
              in thoracic anesthesia; thoracic epidural analgesia represented
              the ``gold standard'' for post-thoracotomy pain relief in
              combination with intravenous analgesia. CONCLUSION: The results
              of this survey showed that Italian anesthesiologist follow the
              recommended standard of care for anesthetic management during
              OLV.",

              university hospital. PARTICIPANTS \& INTERVENTIONS: After
              institutional review board approval, 29 patients who underwent
              thoracic surgical procedures using video double-lumen tubes were
              included in the final retrospective analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND
              MAIN RESULTS: For 27 (93.2\%) patients, the use of fiberoptic
              bronchoscopy was not needed either for initial placement or for
              verification of correct video double-lumen tube placement upon
              final positioning of the patient. However, for two patients,
              fiberoptic bronchoscopy was needed: for (1) one patient with
              severe left mainstem bronchus distortion as a result of a large
              left upper lobe tumor, and (2) a second patient with secretions
              that were difficult to clear. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates
              that the video double-lumen tube requires significantly less
              (6.8\%) fiberoptic use for both initial placement and
              verification of final position, in stark contrast to standard
              practice in which bronchoscopy is always used to verify final
              positioning of the double-lumen tube. As opposed to intermittent
              bronchoscopy, the continuous visualization offered by an embedded

               experiencing emotional distress, especially depression, report a
               craving and preference for sweet carbohydrate/fat rich foods.
               This relationship exists in individuals experiencing fall/winter
               seasonal affective disorder, premenstrual syndrome, and some
               obse individuals. The cravings and preference for these foods
               occur only during the fall and winter in indivuduals with
               seasonal affective disorder and in the luteal phase of the
               menstrual cycle in individuals with premenstrual disorder which
               is the time when symptoms of depression are experienced.
               Additionally, unipolar depressed individuals increase their
               preference for sweet carbohydrate/fat rich foods as they become
               depressed. They also increase their consumption of carbohydrates
               from sucrose. Several studies indicate that sweet
               carbohydrate/fat rich foods are consumed because of the
               resulting mood enhancement. However, other studies have revealed
               that elimination of intake of added sucrose and/or caffeine from
               the diet of unipolar depressed individuals results in an
               amelioration of depression that is maintained as long as the
               substance they are sensitive to, added sucrose or caffeine, is
               not consumed. The cravings and preference which some depressed
               individuals have for sweet carbohydrate/fat rich foods seems to
               result from the enhancement in mood following consumption.
               Paradoxically, however, a better long-term strategy for mood
               enhancement may be to totally eliminate added sucrose and

              in women of reproductive age. However, most of them are
              asymptomatic and do not require any treatment. Menorrhagia and
              pelvic pain are the most usual symptoms, and some women may
              present with infertility or pregnancy-related complications. In
              those with abnormal uterine bleeding, one should exclude other
              causes of abnormal vaginal bleeding including endometrial cancer.
              Diagnosis of uterine fibroid is established by pelvic
              ultrasonography with or without saline infusion
              hysterosonography. Management options depend on the patient's
              fertility potential and desire for future pregnancy. Submucous
              myoma should be treated by a hysteroscopic approach. Intramural
              and subserous myomas in women who opt for nonsurgical treatment
              could be treated with uterine artery embolization (UAE),

              relief relative to current medical management. Patients wishing
              to preserve their fertility are best treated by myomectomy, which
              can be done by laparoscopy. A laparoscopic approach is more
              advantageous than laparotomy, but laparoscopic suturing is more
              demanding. This can be overcome by robotic-assisted laparoscopic

               the ages of 7 and 17 years who had a primary diagnosis of
               separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or
               social phobia to receive 14 sessions of cognitive behavioral
               therapy, sertraline (at a dose of up to 200 mg per day), a
               combination of sertraline and cognitive behavioral therapy, or a

              noninferior to radiofrequency ablation in symptomatic patients
              with drug-refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The primary
              efficacy end point in a time-to-event analysis was the first

              antiarrhythmic drugs, or repeat ablation) following a 90-day

              prespecified as a hazard ratio of 1.43. The primary safety end
              point was a composite of death, cerebrovascular events, or

              patients underwent randomization (378 assigned to cryoballoon
              ablation and 384 assigned to radiofrequency ablation). The mean

              considered Indigenous people's understandings of mental health
              and provided details on methodology. Five articles from four
              qualitative studies met these criteria. Meta-ethnography was used
              to identify common themes emerging from the original studies.
              Reciprocal translation was used to synthesize the findings to
              provide new interpretations extending beyond those presented in
              the original studies. An overarching theme emerged from the
              synthesis: the dynamic interconnectedness between the
              multi-factorial components of life circumstances. Reciprocal
              translations and synthesis regarding Indigenous understandings of
              mental health and illness resulted in five themes: (i) culture

              Diagnosis at an early stage has been suggested crucial for

              One potential facilitator to early diagnosis is low-dose computed

              Force guidelines call for annual LDCT screening for individuals

              effectiveness of LDCT in early diagnosis of lung cancer, as
              indicated by the findings from the National Lung Screening Trial
              conducted in 2011. Although lung cancer accounts for more than a

               suggested that both the formal and informal contexts of

               available literature regarding diagnoses similarities,
               presentation uniqueness, assessment/assessment tools, and
               suggested treatments of ON. Method/Design: A literature search
               of four databases focusing on articles published between 2000
               and 2016 was conducted to evaluate the status of the literature

               confusion about use of assessment tools existed, and the lack of
               evidence based treatments for ON was pronounced. Conclusion:
               More research is needed to determine the prevalence of
               pathologically unhealthy, obsessive, ?self-defined healthy,?
               eating behaviors, and to determine if ON is a unique eating

              regard to content, the most common focus was on race followed by
              gender, ethnicity, and religion/spirituality. An examination of

              that supervisors' frequently educated and facilitated exploration

              (1902--1987) was designed to promote openness, growth and change
              in understanding the counseling processes. It is an approach
              which is practical and helpful in education, because it can solve
              some of the problems outside the curriculum faced by students.
              For example it provides a way of understanding and solving issues
              of relationships, emotional development and ethical behaviour
              that seem to be at the root of most of the problems in school and
              society at large. However, it is essential to incorporate some
              accelerating ingredients to inform conditions which facilitate
              growth. These include acceptance, empathy and positive regard
              from others. For example it has been realized that if an
              individual is denied acceptance and positive regard they fail to
              relate the meaning of their experience to themselves and positive
              growth in such a relevant way is inhibited. However, the approach
              is faced with some drawbacks which will be explored. Teaching
              today in British schools is a very challenging job. It is
              becoming increasingly difficult to establish a classroom
              environment that is free from disruptive behaviour. The
              person-centred approach, where the student as the client is made
              responsible of his or her own behaviour, could be part of the
              solution. This could be the focus of an educational yet assertive

              rapid diagnosis is still a challenge since an ischemic stroke
              cannot be identified based only on clinical assessment. CT or MRI
              imaging is required to rule out hemorrhagic stroke since
              thrombolytic therapy can lead to increased intracranial bleeding
              and further aggravation of hemorrhagic stroke. In addition,
              clinical situations that imitate the signs and symptoms of stroke
              may also impede the rapid diagnosis and treatment of stroke
              victims. It is therefore of value to discover non-invasive tests
              that aim to quickly distinguish stroke from stroke mimics and
              distinguish ischemic from hemorrhagic stroke. Identifying blood

              far not only for reasons related to patients and the disease

  abstract  = "ABSTRACTAn increased interest in health, diet, and physical
               activity exist among young people, in this study termed ?fitness
               hype?. Viewing the body and health as commodities can be
               understood as part of a healthism discourse. In this study, we
               explored how Swedish high school students perceive and negotiate
               the trend regarding exercise, diet and body ideals.
               Semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten high school
               students, aged 16?18 years, from various educational programs
               and with varying levels of physical activity. Using qualitative
               content analysis, we developd one overarching theme navigating
               life satisfaction in the face of an ?unhealthy fitness hype?.
               Four additional, interrelated categories showed how the young
               people negotiated this developing trend through: (1) the quest
               for social recognition and value, (2) social media sets the
               standards, (3) the paradox of strong and skinny as the new
               standard, and (4) the need for new safety nets. Our results
               highlight the young people?s perceptions of an excessive and
               influential focus on health and exercise in contemporary
               society. They described a fitness hype as exorbitant and
               unhealthy ideals of body and exercise, and understood this as
               problematic. Social media was seen as contributing to this hype
               as a powerful arena for ?the quest for social recognition and
               value?. While not all the young people felt negatively affected
               by the fitness hype, they perceived its influence on their
               lives. Further, body and fitness ideals were gendered. Teenage
               girls faced the paradox of shaping themselves as ?strong and
               skinny?. Social ties were recognized as an important safety net,
               particularly classmates, sports mates, and coaches. Knowledge of
               these problems from the perspective of young people is crucially
               needed among health professionals and educators. Further
               research should explore additional support strategies, and young
               people?s experiences of fitness hype among additional youth
               groups.",

              urolithiasis substantially and are now the first-choice treatment
              for kidney and ureteral stones. First clinical investigations of
              the shock-wave treatment of Induratio Penis Plastica (IPP) are

              healing processes in tendons, surrounding tissue and bones. This
              is a completely different approach from that of urology, where
              shock waves are used for disintegration. This paper gives an

              discourses of difference in which Swiss culture is centred and
              foreign ones are marginalised. At present, Eastern and South-East
              European cultures are particularly affected. In this article, we
              challenge perceived cultural incommensurability by examining the
              socialisation of second-generation girls of immigrant background,
              through data generated from semi-structured interviews with them.
              The girls draw on a tightly defined discursive range of
              linguistic resources to construct the meanings of sport, health
              and the body. Specifically, the girls refer to healthism, within
              which sport is seen to provide a means to achieve good health and
              a slim and feminine body. These references reflect a set of
              knowledge and discourses important to Western cultures.
              Alternative discursive resources exist, yet were not utilised. We
              argue that the girls' adoption of healthist ideas is used to
              counter cultural narratives---such as the uncultured, and thus
              non-integrated, immigrant---and that this adoption supports and

              psychologists alike recognize the challenge of maintaining hope
              when working with difficult presenting problems and demoralized
              clients. As professionals, to hold hope in session while
              witnessing our clients' hopelessness and experiencing our own can
              be very difficult. The importance of client hope is well
              recognized in psychotherapy research, yet research exploring
              psychologists' own experiences of hope has been neglected. This
              study, part of a larger program of research on hope in

              Combining contemporary psychodynamic, Jungian and gender identity
              theory, this approach reflects the unique path of transgender
              identity development. Transgender identity is not viewed as
              inherently pathological. Rather, the issues that emerge in
              psychotherapy with transgender clients, like with all people, are
              about the self and self-in-relation, negotiating identity with
              outer reality. For the transgender person, however, psychological
              issues are particularly related to faulty mirroring during
              periods of identity construction because the transgender self is
              often invisible to the outside world. Transgender identity
              development involves a body/mind mismatch and is affected by
              social stigma associated with gender variance. Transgender
              individuals negotiate their transgendered self in a world that
              sees gender as binary, resulting in a tension between desire,
              authenticity and avoidance of stigma. A composite trajectory of
              pre-, during- and post-coming out of transgender identity
              development is presented and potential therapeutic themes and

  abstract = "PURPOSE: Past research with JACO has principally focused on the
              short-term impacts on new users. Therefore, this study aims to
              document the long-term impacts of this assistive device on users
              and their family caregivers following prolonged use. METHODS:
              Users' characteristics, caregivers' characteristics and expenses
              related to JACO were documented with questionnaires designed for
              this study. Upper extremity performance was measured with an
              adaptation of an upper extremity performance test, the TEMPA, and
              accomplishment of life habits was documented in an interview
              based on the LIFE-H questionnaire. Satisfaction with JACO and
              psychosocial impacts of its use were measured with validated
              questionnaires, namely the QUEST and the PIADS-10. Impacts of
              JACO on family caregivers were documented with a validated
              questionnaire, the CATOM. Descriptive statistics were used to
              report the results. RESULTS: Seven users and five caregivers were
              recruited. One user had expenses related to JACO in the past two
              months. Users had a better upper extremity performance with JACO
              than without it and they used their robotic arm to accomplish
              certain life habits. Most users were satisfied with JACO and the
              psychosocial impacts were positive. Impacts on family caregivers
              were slight. CONCLUSIONS: JACO increased performance in
              manipulation and facilitated the accomplishment of certain life
              habits. Users' increased participation in their life habits may
              slightly decrease the amount of caregiver assistance required.
              Future studies are needed to clarify its economic potential, its
              impact on caregivers' burden, including paid caregivers, and the
              variability in the tasks performed using JACO. Implications for
              Rehabilitation The use of JACO may have positive impacts on its
              users in terms of upper extremity performance, accomplishment of
              life habits, satisfaction with the device and psychosocial
              impacts. More research is needed to quantify more accurately the
              economic potential of the long-term use of JACO, to explore the
              factors related to the variability in the tasks performed using
              JACO, and to clarify the impact of JACO on caregivers' burden,

              lithotripsy (SWL) vs ureteroscopic lithotripsy (URS) for patients
              with renal stones <1.5 cm in diameter. METHODS: Patient age,
              stone diameter, stone location, and stone-free status were
              recorded for patients treated with SWL or URS for renal stones
              <1.5 cm in maximal diameter over a 1-year period. Institutional
              charges were obtained from in-house billing. A decision analysis

              Three separate models were created to reflect practice patterns
              for SWL. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-eight patients were included
              in the study-78 underwent SWL and 80 underwent URS as primary
              treatment. Single procedure stone-free rates (SFR) for SWL and
              URS were 55\% and 95\%, respectively (P<0.0001). Decision
              analysis modeling demonstrated cost-effectiveness of SWL when SWL
              single procedure SFR were 65\% to 67\% or when URS single
              procedure SFR was 72\% to 84\%. CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective
              study revealed superior SFR results for renal stones <1.5 cm for
              URS compared with SWL. Our decision analysis model demonstrates
              that for SWL SFR less than 65\% to 67\% or for URS SFR greater
              than 72\% to 84\%, SWL is not a cost-effective treatment option.
              Based on these findings, careful stratification and selection of

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: The frequency of flexible ureteroscopy has
              increased with the introduction of improved instrumentation.
              Ureteroscopes allow increased endoscopic access to the ureter and
              kidney. However, maintenance and repair of scopes may increase
              the total procedure expense. METHODS: In 3 years (8/2011-7/2014),
              655 flexible ureteroscopies were performed at a single-specialty,
              urology, ambulatory surgery center. Procedures were performed by
              26 board-certified urologists using four Olympus URF P5 flexible
              ureteroscopes. The instruments were handled by a single team and
              sterilized through the STERIS System E1. Repairs were performed
              by the manufacturer on an as needed basis. Patient records were
              reviewed to determine the preoperative diagnosis, operative time,
              location and size of the stone, and use of laser or ureteral
              sheath. The occurrence, nature of flexible ureteroscope damage,
              and cost of repairs were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the
              ureteroscopies performed, 78\% was for the treatment of calculi
              (50.1\% in the kidney). Mean stone size was 8.5 $\pm$ 0.2 mm,
              with larger stones (11 mm) located in the kidney. The flexible
              ureteroscope was advanced over a guidewire (88\% of cases); a
              laser fiber was introduced in 70\%, and a ureteral sheath was
              used in 13.4\%. Mean procedure time was 40 minutes. The most
              common reasons for ureteroscope repair were cloudy lens (16
              repairs) and broken optic fibers (9 repairs). There were 31
              repairs during the study period (average 21 cases per repair).
              Flexible ureteroscopes were out of service for an average of 11
              days per repair (range 3-20). The total cost of repairs was
              \$233,150 or ∼\$7521 per repair. The average repair cost per
              flexible ureteroscopy performed was \$355. CONCLUSIONS: Expenses
              associated with instrument repair can significantly impact a
              procedure's net revenue, thus efforts should be made to minimize
              instrument breakage. The expense of repairing a flexible
              ureteroscope per procedure can be significant and needs to be
              considered when pricing this procedure.",

              designed and conducted between March and December 2015. We
              included women having at least one stone in the distal ureter and
              being a candidate for surgical treatment using the 4.85F sheath
              of MicroPerc\textregistered{}. Patients with clinical criteria
              and/or laboratory analysis indicating sepsis or coagulation
              alteration were excluded. RESULTS: Thirty-nine women were
              operated in eight hospitals. The profile of the patients was
              fairly homogeneous among hospitals. Only differences were found
              in age, preoperative stent, and the result of the previous urine
              culture. Immediate stone-free status was achieved in 88.2\% and
              100\% 7 days after the procedure. 97.4\% of patients did not
              present any complication in the postoperative period, with only
              one case with complication Clavien II. Postureteroscopic Lesion
              Scale (PULS) in 76.9\% of patients did not show any injury,
              20.5\% had lesions grade 1, and grade 2 lesions 2.6\%. As for the

              nerve block system and its impact on learning regional
              anaesthesia skills. We compared success rates, learning curves,
              performance times, and inter-subject performance variability of

              needle guidance. The hypothesis of this study is that robot
              assistance will result in faster skill acquisition than manual
              needle guidance. METHODS: Five co-authors with different
              experience with nerve blocks and the robotic system performed
              both manual and robot-assisted, US-guided nerve blocks on two
              different nerves of a nerve phantom. Ten trials were performed
              for each of the four procedures. Time taken to move from a shared
              starting position till the needle was inserted into the target
              nerve was defined as the performance time. A successful block was
              defined as the insertion of the needle into the target nerve.
              Average performance times were compared using analysis of
              variance. P<0.05 was considered significant. Data presented as
              mean (standard deviation). RESULTS: All blocks were successful.
              There were significant differences in performance times between
              co-authors to perform the manual blocks, either superficial
              (P=0.001) or profound (P=0.0001); no statistical difference
              between co-authors was noted for the robot-assisted blocks.
              Linear regression indicated that the average decrease in time
              between consecutive trials for robot-assisted blocks of 1.8 (1.6)
              s was significantly (P=0.007) greater than the decrease for
              manual blocks of 0.3 (0.3) s. CONCLUSIONS: Robot assistance of
              nerve blocks allows for faster learning of needle guidance over
              manual positioning and reduces inter-subject performance
              variability.",

              digital computer-generated real-time holographic display of
              patient's 3D data could provide a spatially accurate image with
              all the depth cues and afford interaction within the image.
              METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a feasibility study of creating
              real-time interactive 3D digital holograms with a purpose-built
              prototype using intraprocedural data from 3D rotational
              angiography and live 3D transesophageal echocardiography. The
              primary objective was to demonstrate that all the anatomical
              landmarks identified on standard imaging can be similarly
              identified using dynamic and static holographic images. The
              secondary objective was to demonstrate the usability of
              interactions with the image. Parameters were assessed by a rating

              transcatheter ASD closure using 3DTEE and three patients were
              evaluated by 3D rotational angiography. In all cases dynamic
              real-time and static 3D holograms were created in standard cath
              lab conditions. Four individual observers identified all
              anatomical landmarks on the holographic display independently

              with CrCl 30-49 mL/min, the primary endpoint of stroke or
              systemic embolism occurred in 2.32 per 100 patient-years with
              rivaroxaban 15 mg/day vs. 2.77 per 100 patient-years with
              warfarin [hazard ratio (HR) 0.84; 95\% confidence interval (CI)
              0.57-1.23] in the per-protocol population. Intention-to-treat
              analysis yielded similar results (HR 0.86; 95\% CI 0.63-1.17) to
              the per-protocol results. Rates of the principal safety endpoint
              (major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding: 17.82 vs.
              18.28 per 100 patient-years; P = 0.76) and intracranial bleeding
              (0.71 vs. 0.88 per 100 patient-years; P = 0.54) were similar with
              rivaroxaban or warfarin. Fatal bleeding (0.28 vs. 0.74\% per 100
              patient-years; P = 0.047) occurred less often with rivaroxaban.
              CONCLUSION: Patients with AF and moderate renal insufficiency
              have higher rates of stroke and bleeding than those with normal
              renal function. There was no evidence of heterogeneity in
              treatment effect across dosing groups. Dose adjustment in
              ROCKET-AF yielded results consistent with the overall trial in
              comparison with dose-adjusted warfarin.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: On 31 December 2013, the US Preventive Services Task
              Force rated low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) for lung cancer
              screening as level 'B' recommendation. Yet, lung cancer screening
              implementation remains controversial, particularly when
              considering its cost-effectiveness. The aim of this work is to
              investigate the cost-effectiveness of LDCT screening program for
              lung cancer by performing a systematic literature review.
              METHODS: We reviewed the published economic evaluations of LDCT
              in lung cancer screening. MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science and
              Cochrane databases were searched for literature retrieval up to
              31 March 2015. Inclusion criteria included: studies reporting an
              original full economic evaluation; reports presenting the
              outcomes as Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) gained or as Life
              Years Gained. RESULTS: Nine economic evaluations met the
              inclusion criteria. All the cost-effectiveness analyses included
              high risk populations for lung cancer and compared the use of
              annual LDCT screening with no screening. Seven studies reported
              an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio below the threshold of
              US\$ 100 000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness of
              LDCT screening for lung cancer is an highly debatable issue.
              Currently available economic evaluations suggest the
              cost-effectiveness of LDCT for lung cancer screening compared
              with no screening and indicate that the implementation of LDCT
              should be considered when planning a national lung cancer
              screening program. Additional economic evaluations, especially
              from a societal perspective and in an EU-setting, are needed.",

              well documented. Government policy in Scotland recommends
              reducing salt, refined sugar and saturated fat in the diet and
              increasing the consumption of fruit and vegetables,
              carbohydrates, fibre and oily fish. METHODS: Using data from the
              1998 Scottish Health Survey a composite measure of healthy eating
              behaviour was derived by scoring low levels of consumption of
              salt, refined sugar and saturated fat and higher consumption of
              fruit and vegetables, carbohydrates, fibre and oily fish. This
              paper presents results from logistic regression analysis of the
              risk factors for this measure of healthy eating behaviour.
              RESULTS: Young people, men, those on low income, those without

              intensive care unit patients undergoing endoscopic percutaneous
              tracheotomy using the multiple and single dilator techniques was
              conducted to assess the feasibility and safety of the procedure
              as it compares with surgical tracheotomy. Endoscopy was used in
              all cases and evaluated as an added safety measure in reducing
              complications. Study Design: A prospective evaluation of
              endoscopic percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy in 500
              consecutive adult, intubated intensive care unit patients.
              Methods: Between 1990 and 2003, endoscopically guided
              percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy (PDT) was performed in 500
              consecutive adult, intubated patients in the intensive care units
              (ICU) of three tertiary care adult hospitals. The first 191
              patients underwent PDT using the Ciaglia Percutaneous
              Tracheostomy Introducer Kit (Cook Critical Care Inc.,
              Bloomington, Indiana) and in the remaining 309 patients the
              Ciaglia Blue Rhino Single Dilator Kit (Cook Critical Care Inc.,
              Bloomington, Indiana) was used. The procedure was contraindicated
              in the following situations: 1) children, 2) unprotected airway,
              3) emergencies, 4) presence of a midline neck mass, 5) inability
              to palpate the cricoid cartilage, and 6) uncorrectable
              coagulopathy. The following parameters were recorded
              preoperatively: age, sex, diagnosis, American Society of
              Anesthesia (ASA) class, body mass index (BMI), and number of days
              intubated. Recorded hematologic parameters included hemoglobin
              (Hgb), platelets, prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin
              time (PTT), and the international normalized ratio (INR) since it
              became available in 1998. All patients were ventilated on 100\%
              oxygen and vital signs were continuously monitored. Tracheotomy
              was carried out under continuous endoscopic guidance using a
              series of graduated dilators in the first 191 cases, and a
              single, tapered dilator in the remaining 309 patients. The
              preoperative data on each patient, along with the type of dilator
              used, the size of the tube, the intraoperative and postoperative
              complications, and blood loss information were recorded
              prospectively and maintained in a computer spreadsheet.
              Univariate analyses were used in each group separately for each
              type of dilator to assess the risks of a complication within
              subgroups defined by each parameter/characteristic, and the
              statistical significance assessed with a $\chi$2 test, or Fisher
              exact test. Results: The total complication rate was 9.2\%
              (13.6\% in the multiple dilator group, and 6.5\% in the single
              dilator group), with more than half of these considered minor.
              Overall, the two most common complications were oxygen
              desaturation in 14 cases and bleeding in 12 cases. The absence of
              serious complications such as pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum
              are attributable to the use of bronchoscopy. There was no
              significant association between the rate of complications and
              age, gender, ASA, weeks intubated, tracheostomy tube size, Hgb
              levels, platelets, PT, PTT, or INR. There was a statistically
              significant relationship between experience and the likelihood of
              complications in the multiple dilator group (P < .0001), with a
              higher rate of complications in the first 30 patients (40\%)
              compared with 8.7\% in the remaining 161 patients. This
              relationship did not exist for the first 30 patients in the
              single dilator group. Patients with a BMI of 30 or higher
              experienced a significantly greater (P < .05) number of
              complications (15\%), compared with an 8\% complication rate in
              patients with a BMI of less than 30. This risk was even more
              significant for patients with a BMI of 30 or greater who were
              also in ASA class 4 (11/56 or 20\%) (P < .02). Conclusions:
              Endoscopic PDT is associated with a low complication rate and is
              at least as safe as surgical tracheotomy in the ICU setting.
              Bronchoscopy significantly decreases the incidence of
              complications and should be used routinely. While embraced by
              critical care physicians, endoscopic PDT has been infrequently
              performed by otolaryngologists. As the airway experts,
              otolaryngologists are in the best position to learn and teach the
              procedure as it should be done.",

              tool to automate the performance of regional techniques reducing
              the anesthesiologist's workload and improving patient care. The
              purpose of this review is to show the latest findings in robotic
              regional anesthesia. RECENT FINDINGS: The literature separates
              robots in anesthesia into two groups: pharmacological robots and
              manual robots. Pharmacological robots are mainly closed-loop
              systems that help in the titration of anesthetic drugs to
              patients undergoing surgery. Manual robots are mechanical robots

              have focused on the development of decision support systems and
              closed-loop systems, more recent evidence supports the concept

              lesser extent in the field of anesthesia. The purpose of this
              review is to show the latest and most important findings in
              robotic anesthesia. Moreover, this review argues the importance
              and utility of robots in anesthesia. RECENT FINDINGS: Over the
              years, many closed-loop systems have been developed; they were
              able to control only one or two of the three components of
              anesthesia: hypnosis, analgesia, or muscle relaxation. McSleepy
              controls all three components of anesthesia, from induction to
              emergence of anesthesia. Telemedical applications have not only
              led to remote monitoring but even to remotely controlled
              anesthesia, such as transcontinental anesthesia. A new
              closed-loop system for sedation, called Sedasys, could
              revolutionize the field of nonoperating room sedation. 'Manual
              robots' are used to help and replace anesthesiologists performing
              anesthesia procedures. Specific robots for intubation and nerve

              Tuttlingen, Germany) with conventional direct laryngoscopy in
              patients with predicted difficult airway. METHODS: We conducted a
              two arm, single-blinded randomized controlled trial that involved
              300 patients. Inclusion required at least one of four predictors
              of difficult intubation. The primary outcome was successful
              tracheal intubation on first attempt. RESULTS: The use of video
              laryngoscopy resulted in more successful intubations on first
              attempt (138/149; 93\%) as compared with direct laryngoscopy
              (124/147; 84\%), P = 0.026. Cormack-Lehane laryngeal view was
              graded I or II in 139/149 of C-MAC attempts versus 119/147 in
              direct laryngoscopy attempts (P < 0.01). Laryngoscopy time
              averaged 46 s (95\% CI, 40-51) for the C-MAC group and was
              shorter in the direct laryngoscopy group, 33 s (95\% CI, 29-36),
              P < 0.001. The use of a gum-elastic bougie and/or external
              laryngeal manipulation were required less often in the C-MAC
              intubations (24\%, 33/138) compared with direct laryngoscopy
              (37\%, 46/124, P = 0.020). The incidence of complications was not
              significantly different between the C-MAC (20\%, 27/138) versus
              direct laryngoscopy (13\%, 16/124, P = 0.146). CONCLUSION: A
              diverse group of anesthesia providers achieved a higher
              intubation success rate on first attempt with the C-MAC in a
              broad range of patients with predictors of difficult intubation.
              C-MAC laryngoscopy seems to be a useful technique for the initial
              approach to a potentially difficult airway.",

              years, with a 90-day history of suicide attempt, a current
              diagnosis of depressive disorder (96.0\% had major depressive

              on suicide prevention, or their combination (Comb), at five
              academic sites. Treatment assignment could be either random or
              chosen by study participants. Intent-to-treat, mixed effects
              regression models of depression and other relevant ratings were
              estimated. Improvement and remission rates were computed with the
              last observation carried forward. RESULTS: Most patients (n = 104
              or 84\%) chose treatment assignment, and overall, three fourths
              (n = 93) received Comb. In Comb, CDRS-R declined from a baseline
              adjusted mean of 49.6 (SD 12.3) to 38.3 (8.0) at week 12 and to
              27.0 (10.1) at week 24 (p < .0001), with a Clinical Global
              Impression -defined improvement rate of 58.0\% at week 12 and

              minimal invasive surgery using robotics in function of the body
              mass index (BMI) of patients. METHODS: This is a prospective
              cohort study of consecutive women undergoing surgery for
              endometrial cancer at a tertiary care facility since the
              initiation of a robotic program in December 2007. Surgical and
              personal outcome variables as well as quality of life and
              postoperative recovery were assessed using a combination of
              objective and subjective/self-report questionnaires. Women were
              divided into 3 groups based on their BMI. Comparative analyses
              among nonobese (n = 52), obese (n = 33) and morbidly obese (n =
              23) women were performed on the outcome measures after surgery.
              RESULTS: The mean BMI and the range in each of the BMI categories
              was 25 kg/m² (18.7-29.4 kg/m²), 34 kg/m² (30.1-38.4 kg/m²), and
              46 kg/m² (40.0-58.8 kg/m²). Women with higher BMI tended to be
              more frequently affected with comorbidities such as diabetes
              (15.4\%, 26.0\%, and 27.3\%, respectively; P = 0.32) and
              hypertension (55.8\%, 69.6\%, and 69.7\%, respectively; P =
              0.19). Despite these differences, surgical console time (P =
              0.20), major postoperative complications (P = 0.52), overall
              wound complications (P = 0.18), and median length of
              hospitalization in days (P = 0.17) were not statistically
              different among the 3 groups. Only 5.6\% of women needed a mini
              laparotomy all of which were performed for the removal of their
              enlarged uterus, which could not be delivered safely via the
              vagina, at the end of the surgical procedure. There was no
              increased conversion to laparotomy due to increased BMI. Women in
              all 3 groups reported rapid resumption of hygiene regimens and
              chores, little need for narcotic analgesia, and high satisfaction
              with the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Obese and morbidly obese
              patients with endometrial cancer are also good candidates for
              robotic surgery. These women benefit considerably from minimal
              invasive surgery and have little perioperative complications.",

              the 8 edition of the anatomic classification of lung cancer. The
              present analyses concern its primary tumor (T) component.
              METHODS: From 1999 to 2010, 77,156 evaluable patients, 70,967
              with non-small-cell lung cancer, were collected; and 33,115 had
              either a clinical or a pathological classification, known tumor
              size, sufficient T information, and no metastases. Survival was
              measured from date of diagnosis or surgery for clinically and
              pathologically staged tumors. Tumor-size cutpoints were evaluated
              by the running log-rank statistics. T descriptors were evaluated
              in a multivariate Cox regression analysis adjusted for age,
              gender, histological type, and geographic region. RESULTS: The
              3-cm cutpoint significantly separates T1 from T2. From 1 to 5 cm,
              each centimeter separates tumors of significantly different
              prognosis. Prognosis of tumors greater than 5 cm but less than or
              equal to 7 cm is equivalent to T3, and that of those greater than
              7 cm to T4. Bronchial involvement less than 2 cm from carina, but
              without involving it, and total atelectasis/pneumonitis have a T2
              prognosis. Involvement of the diaphragm has a T4 prognosis.
              Invasion of the mediastinal pleura is a descriptor seldom used.
              CONCLUSIONS: Recommended changes are as follows: to subclassify
              T1 into T1a ($\leq$1 cm), T1b (>1 to $\leq$2 cm), and T1c (>2 to
              $\leq$3 cm); to subclassify T2 into T2a (>3 to $\leq$4 cm) and
              T2b (>4 to $\leq$5 cm); to reclassify tumors greater than 5 to
              less than or equal to 7 cm as T3; to reclassify tumors greater
              than 7 cm as T4; to group involvement of main bronchus as T2
              regardless of distance from carina; to group partial and total
              atelectasis/pneumonitis as T2; to reclassify diaphragm invasion
              as T4; and to delete mediastinal pleura invasion as a T

              (NSCLC) is critical for optimal management. Minimally invasive
              pathologic assessment of mediastinal lymphadenopathy is
              increasingly being performed. The cost-benefit (minimization of
              health care costs) of such approaches, in comparison with
              traditional surgical methods, is yet to be established. METHODS:
              Decision-tree analysis was applied to compare downstream costs of
              endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration
              (EBUS-TBNA), conventional TBNA, and surgical mediastinoscopy.
              Calculations were based on real costs derived from actual patient
              data at a major teaching hospital in Melbourne, Australia. One-
              and two-way sensitivity analyses were undertaken to account for
              potential variation in input parameter values. RESULTS: For the
              base-case analysis, initial evaluation with EBUS-TBNA (with
              negative results being surgically confirmed) was the most
              cost-beneficial approach (AU$2961) in comparison with EBUS-TBNA
              (negative results not surgically confirmed) ($3344), conventional
              TBNA ($3754), and mediastinoscopy ($8859). The sensitivity of
              EBUS-TBNA for detecting disease had the largest impact on cost,
              whereas the prevalence of mediastinal lymph node metastases
              determined whether surgical confirmation of negative EBUS-TBNA
              results remained cost-beneficial. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms
              that minimally invasive staging of NSCLC is cost-beneficial in
              comparison with traditional surgical techniques. EBUS-TBNA was
              the most cost-beneficial approach for mediastinal staging of

              practice in Australia and New Zealand through survey in the
              setting of recently published guidelines. METHODS: In June 2014,
              an email survey was sent to every member of The Thoracic Society
              of Australia and New Zealand who was a doctor. RESULTS: Responses
              were received from 258 of 824 doctors. Australia and New Zealand
              was the location of training for 91\% and the United Kingdom for
              9\%. United Kingdom-trained doctors are more likely to conduct
              bronchoscopy from the patient's side rather than from behind. The
              services of anesthetists are utilized by 81\% of private
              bronchoscopists compared with 38\% of public ones. Two sedatives
              are used by 94\% of bronchoscopists, 96\% of whom use midazolam
              and fentanyl and 4\% use midazolam and propofol. When anesthesia
              is provided by anesthetists, 77\% use 2 agents, of which 53\% use
              midazolam and fentanyl and 37\% use midazolam and propofol. Those
              who work publicly conduct more procedures and are younger. For
              patients with heart valve defects, 39\% prescribe prophylactic
              antibiotics and 16\% do not cease clopidogrel where biopsy is
              anticipated. In 2013, pneumothoraces complicated 0.22\% of
              procedures, whereas the mortality rate was 0.019\%. Almost all
              monitor oxygen saturation during the procedures. CONCLUSIONS:
              This survey shows that there is a large variation in bronchoscopy
              practices both generally and between different groups of
              bronchoscopists, yet it is a safe procedure. An important finding
              was the significantly high utilization of the services of

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Robotic bronchoscopy may offer alternative approaches
              to address limitations of current bronchoscopic techniques for
              biopsy of suspected peripheral lung lesions. This study sought to
              evaluate complications and feasibility of robotic bronchoscopy
              performed with the Robotic Endoscopy System (RES). METHODS: Adult
              patients from a single institution underwent bronchoscopy of
              suspected lesions with a bronchus sign with the RES. The primary
              outcome was complication rate, as assessed by the incidence of
              related serious adverse events (SAE). The secondary outcome was
              technical feasibility. Data are presented as median (range),
              counts, and percentage. P-value was calculated using the
              Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Of 17 screened patients, 15 were
              eligible. The median age was 67 (38 to 79) years. The lesions (12
              peripheral and 3 central) were located in the right lower lobe
              (33\%), right upper lobe (27\%), left upper lobe (27\%), and left
              lower lobe (13\%). No SAE, including pneumothorax and significant
              bleeding, occurred. Biopsy samples were obtained from 93\% of
              patients. One sampling (right upper lobe) required conventional
              bronchoscopy and another required surgery to confirm malignancy.
              Cancer was confirmed in 60\% (9/15) of patients. Benign features
              were found in 5 of 6 patients. Time to biopsy location reduced
              from 45 (21 to 84) minutes (first 5 cases) to 20 (7 to 47)
              minutes (last 9 cases), P=0.039. CONCLUSIONS: The study results
              and absence of SAE support feasibility of the RES in accessing
              the periphery of the lung. The RES has potential to address
              challenges associated with biopsy of peripheral lung lesions.This

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs) are frequent and
              can be malignant. Both computed tomography-guided biopsy and
              electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy (ENB) with biopsy can
              be used to diagnose a SPN. A nondiagnostic computed tomography
              (CT)-guided or ENB biopsy is often followed by video-assisted
              thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) biopsy. The relative costs and
              consequences of these strategies are not known. METHODS: A
              decision tree was created with values from the literature to
              evaluate the clinical consequences and societal costs of a
              CT-guided biopsy strategy versus an ENB biopsy strategy for the
              diagnosis of a SPN. The serial use of ENB after nondiagnostic
              CT-guided biopsy and CT-guided biopsy after nondiagnostic ENB
              biopsy were tested as alternate strategies. RESULTS: In a
              hypothetical cohort of 100 patients, use of the ENB biopsy
              strategy on average results in 13.4 fewer pneumothoraces, 5.9
              fewer chest tubes, 0.9 fewer significant hemorrhage episodes, and
              0.6 fewer respiratory failure episodes compared with a CT-guided
              biopsy strategy. ENB biopsy increases average costs by \$3719 per
              case and increases VATS rates by an absolute 20\%. The sequential
              diagnostic strategy that combines CT-guided biopsy after
              nondiagnostic ENB biopsy and vice versa decreases the rate of
              VATS procedures to 3\%. A sequential approach starting with ENB
              decreases average per case cost relative to CT-guided biopsy
              followed by VATS, if needed, by \$507; and a sequential approach
              starting with CT-guided biopsy decreases the cost relative to
              CT-guided biopsy followed by VATS, if needed, by \$979.
              CONCLUSIONS: An ENB with biopsy strategy is associated with
              decreased pneumothorax rate but increased costs and increased use
              of VATS. Combining CT-guided biopsy and ENB with biopsy serially
              can decrease costs and complications.",

              ventilation is associated with a lower incidence of pulmonary
              complications. However, there are few published data on routine
              pulmonary management in adult cardiac surgery. The present
              study's primary objective was to survey pulmonary management in
              this high-risk population, as practiced by anesthesiologists in
              France., All 460 registered France-based cardiac
              anesthesiologists were invited (by e-mail) to participate in an
              online survey in January--February 2015. The survey's
              questionnaire was designed to assess current practice in pre-,
              per-, and postoperative pulmonary management., In all, 198
              anesthesiologists (43\% of those invited) participated in the
              survey. Other than during the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) per
              se, 179 anesthesiologists (91\% of respondees) [95\% confidence
              interval (CI): 87--95] used a low-tidal-volume approach (6--8
              mL/kg), whereas techniques based on positive end-expiratory
              pressure and recruitment maneuvers vary greatly from 1
              anesthesiologist to another. During CPB, 104 (53\%) [95\% CI:
              46--60] anesthesiologists withdrew mechanical ventilation (with
              disconnection, in some cases) and 97 (49\%) [95\% CI: 42--56] did
              not prescribe positive end-expiratory pressure. One hundred
              sixty-five (83\%) [95\% CI: 78--88] anesthesiologists stated that
              a written protocol for peroperative pulmonary management was not
              available. Twenty (10\%) [95\% CI: 6--14] and 11 (5\%) [95\% CI:
              2--8] anesthesiologists stated that they did use protocols for
              ventilator use and recruitment maneuvers, respectively. The
              preoperative period (pulmonary examinations and prescription of
              additional assessments) and the postoperative period (extubation,
              and noninvasive ventilation) periods vary greatly from 1
              anesthesiologist to another., The great majority of French
              cardiac anesthesiologists use a low tidal volume during cardiac
              surgery (other than during CPB per se). However, pulmonary
              management procedures varied markedly from 1 anesthesiologist to
              another. There is a clear need for large clinical studies
              designed to identify best practice in pulmonary management.",

              are controversial. A meta-analysis was conducted to focus on this
              problem. METHODS: Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and
              cohort studies involving RA and FH and published before January
              2017 were searched for using the Cochrane Library, Ovid, Web of

              excluded. The final meta-analysis included 10 articles. RESULTS:
              The accuracy of pedicle screw placement within the RA group was
              significantly greater than the accuracy within the FH group (odds

              12 usability evaluations, and 27 outcome studies together make 47
              evaluations. Technical evaluations were often used as input for

              torques, and range of motion of prototypes. Usability studies

              curves are assessed and define an ideal framework for this

              training and adoption of new procedures and devices. In 2000, a
              review of the learning curve literature was done by Ramsay et al
              and it called for improved reporting and statistical evaluation
              of learning curves. Since then, a body of literature is emerging
              on learning curves but the presentation and analysis vary.
              METHODS: A systematic search was performed of MEDLINE, EMBASE,
              ISI Web of Science, ERIC, and the Cochrane Library from 1985 to
              August 2012. The inclusion criteria are minimally invasive
              abdominal surgery formally analyzing the learning curve and
              English language. 592 (11.1\%) of the identified studies met the
              selection criteria. RESULTS: Time is the most commonly used proxy
              for the learning curve (508, 86\%). Intraoperative outcomes were
              used in 316 (53\%) of the articles, postoperative outcomes in 306
              (52\%), technical skills in 102 (17\%), and patient-oriented
              outcomes in 38 (6\%) articles. Over time, there was evidence of
              an increase in the relative amount of laparoscopic and robotic
              studies (P < 0.001) without statistical evidence of a change in
              the complexity of analysis (P = 0.121). CONCLUSIONS: Assessment
              of learning curves is needed to inform surgical training and
              evaluate new clinical procedures. An ideal analysis would account
              for the degree of complexity of individual cases and the inherent
              differences between surgeons. There is no single proxy that best

              barriers to clinical and academic productivity, research success,
              and work-life balance. We sought to determine if the Eastern
              Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) Mentoring Program
              has met its goals of fostering academic and personal growth in
              young acute care surgeons. METHODS: We conducted a systematic
              program evaluation of EAST Mentoring Program's first 4 years.
              Demographic information was collected from EAST records,
              mentorship program applications, and mentee-mentor career
              development plans. We reviewed the career development plans for
              thematic commonalities and results of a structured, online
              questionnaire distributed since program inception. A mixed
              methods approach was used to better understand the program goals
              from both mentee and mentor perspectives, as well as attitudes
              and barriers regarding the perceived success of this career
              development program. RESULTS: During 2012 to 2015, 65 mentoring
              dyads were paired and 60 completed the program. Of 184 surveys
              distributed, 108 were returned (57\% response rate). Respondents
              were evenly distributed between mentees and mentors (53 vs. 55, p
              = 0.768). In participant surveys, mentoring relationships were
              viewed to focus on research (45\%), ``sticky situations'' (e.g.,
              communication, work-life balance) (27\%), education (18\%), or
              administrative issues (10\%). Mentees were more focused on
              research and education versus mentors (74\% vs. 50\%; p = 0.040).
              Mentees felt that goals were ``always'' or ``usually'' met versus
              mentors (89\% vs. 77\%; p = 0.096). Two barriers to successful
              mentorship included time and communication, with most pairs
              communicating by email. Most respondents (91\%) planned to
              continue the relationship beyond the EAST Mentoring Program and
              recommended the experience to colleagues. CONCLUSION: Mentee
              satisfaction with the EAST Mentoring Program was high. Mentoring
              is a beneficial tool to promote success among EAST's young
              members, but differences exist between mentee and mentor
              perceptions. Revising communication expectations and time
              commitment to improve career development may help our young acute
              care surgeons.",

               catheters are steered through the vasculature from the insertion
               point in the groin area to the atrium. The outcome of this
               procedure depends on a number of factors, among which is the
               correct placement of the catheter tip on the target tissue. The
               tip/tissue contact angle is adjusted by using a manual prismatic
               knob on the proximal handle to bend the deflectable distal shaft
               of the catheter. With the goal of developing a robotics-assisted
               catheter manipulation system, in this paper, we focus on the
               problem of controlling the bending of the distal shaft when the
               proximal handle is used within a robotic manipulator. To this
               end, we apply the black-box modeling technique and perform an
               extensive experimental study to characterize the behavior of the
               catheter. The relationship between proximal measurements and the
               distal tip angle is then determined by fitting a model to the

               control system that adjusts the bending of the distal shaft
               merely based on proximal measurements with no feedback from the
               distal end. The performance of the designed control scheme is
               evaluated through experimental implementation. The results show
               that the control system can achieve the desired tip angle with
               an error less than 2 deg.",

              three nine-degree-of-freedom (9-DOF) inertial measurement units

              optimize a procedure for a particular patient. To minimize

              class of these flexible robots, known as concentric tube robots.
              A key feature of the design is the use of three-dimensional
              printed waffle gears to enable compact control of two degrees of
              freedom within each module. We measure the precision and accuracy
              of a single actuation module and demonstrate the ability of an
              integrated set of three actuation modules to control six degrees
              of freedom. The integrated system drives a three-tube concentric
              tube robot to reach a final tip position that is on average less
              than 2 mm from a given target. In addition, we show a handheld

              lung-cancer staging. In standard practice, however, physicians
              differ greatly in their levels of performance. To address this
              concern, image-guided intervention (IGI) systems have been
              devised to improve procedure success. Current IGI bronchoscopy
              systems based on virtual bronchoscopic navigation (VBN), however,
              require involvement from the attending technician. This lessens
              physician control and hinders the overall acceptance of such
              systems. We propose a hands-free VBN system for planning and
              guiding bronchoscopy. The system introduces two major
              contributions. First, it incorporates a new procedure-planning
              method that automatically computes airway navigation plans
              conforming to the physician's bronchoscopy training and manual
              dexterity. Second, it incorporates a guidance strategy for
              bronchoscope navigation that enables user-friendly system control
              via a foot switch, coupled with a novel position-verification
              mechanism. Phantom studies verified that the system enables
              smooth operation under physician control, while also enabling
              faster navigation than an existing technician-assisted VBN
              system. In a clinical human study, we noted a 97\% bronchoscopy
              navigation success rate, in line with existing VBN systems, and a
              mean guidance time per diagnostic site = 52 s. This represents a
              guidance time often nearly 3 min faster per diagnostic site than
              guidance times reported for other technician-assisted VBN
              systems. Finally, an ergonomic study further asserts the system's

              this paper, we aim at system error prediction for a BSS, i.e., we
              predict occurrences of the abnormal state or behavior of the BSS.
              Because the occurrences of system errors are rare events in the
              BSS (i.e., the dataset of system status is highly imbalanced), it
              is highly challenging to use machine learning or deep learning
              algorithms to predict system error for the BSS. To address this
              challenge, we propose a machine learning based framework for the
              system error prediction and a Frequency-based Feature Creation

              aspiration, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and brushing for the
              diagnosis of pulmonary neoplasia not visible endoscopically.
              METHODS: We retrospectively assessed 207 consecutive patients
              with a final diagnosis of peripheral lung malignancy who
              underwent bronchoscopy with non-guided aspiration, brushing, and
              BAL as their initial evaluation. The influence of clinical and
              radiological factors on diagnostic yield was assessed using
              univariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: The overall
              sensitivity of non-guided bronchoscopy was 25.6\%, whereas
              sensitivities for bronchial aspiration, BAL, and brushing were
              14.2\%, 11.6\%, and 16.5\%, respectively. Younger age, larger
              lesion, central/intermediate distance from the hilum, presence of
              a bronchus sign, and higher standardized uptake value (SUV) on
              positron emission tomography scan were predictors of a higher
              diagnostic yield. Conversely, forced expiratory volume in one
              second, fellow implication in the procedure, and tumor histology
              did not influence sensitivity. The overall sensitivity of
              bronshoscopy was >40\% for tumors >4 cm, located in the
              central/intermediate thirds of the lung, showing a bronchus sign,
              with an SUV >12 or occurring in patients <50 years of age.
              Conversely, the sensitivity was <10\% for tumors <2 cm, located
              peripherally or with an SUV <4. CONCLUSION: Neoplasia
              characteristics may help targeting situations in which
              conventional bronchoscopy could be used as the initial diagnostic
              procedure when advanced techniques are unavailable. However,

              bronchial tree simulator based on a human thorax computed
              tomography scan using rapid-prototyping (3D-print) technology.
              This randomised, single-blind study evaluated how realistic our

              Thirty experienced anaesthetists and respiratory physicians used
              a fibreoptic bronchoscope to rate each simulator on a visual
              analogue scale (VAS) (0 mm = completely unrealistic anatomy, 100
              mm = indistinguishable from real patient) for: localisation of

              blocker in the left main bronchus; aspiration of fluid from the
              right lower lobe; and overall realism. The 3D-printed simulator
              was rated most realistic for the localisation of the right upper
              lobe bronchial lumen (p = 0.002), but no differences were found

              this in airway management. US has several advantages for imaging
              of the airway - it is safe, quick, repeatable, portable, widely
              available, and it must be used dynamically for maximum benefit in
              airway management, in direct conjunction with the airway
              management, i.e. immediately before, during, and after airway
              interventions. US can be used for direct observation of whether
              the tube enters the trachea or the esophagus by placing the
              ultrasound probe transversely on the neck at the level of the
              suprasternal notch during intubation, thus confirming intubation
              without the need for ventilation or circulation. US can be
              applied before anesthesia induction and diagnose several
              conditions that affect airway management, but it remains to be
              determined in which kind of patients the predictive value of such
              an examination is high enough to recommend this as a routine

              ProMIS(\textregistered{}) (Haptica, Ireland)for inclusion in the

  abstract = "BACKGROUND Information technology (IT) has been advocated as an
              important means to improve the practice of clinical medicine.
              OBJECTIVES To determine current prevalence of non-electronic
              health record (EHR) IT use by a national sample of U.S.
              physicians, and to identify associated physician, practice, and
              patient panel characteristics. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
              Survey conducted in early 2004 of 1,662 U.S. physicians engaged
              in direct patient care selected from 3 primary care specialties
              (family practice, internal medicine, pediatrics) and 3 nonprimary
              care specialties (anesthesiology, general surgery, cardiology).
              MEASUREMENTS Self-reported frequency of e-mail communication with
              patients or other clinicians, online access to continuing medical
              education or professional journals, and use of any computerized
              decision support (CDS) during clinical care. Survey results were
              weighted by specialty and linked via practice zip codes to
              measures of area income and urbanization. RESULTS Response rate
              was 52.5\%. Respondents spent 49 ($\pm$19) (mean [$\pm$standard
              deviation]) hours per week in direct patient care and graduated
              from medical school 23 ($\pm$11) years earlier. ``Frequent'' use
              was highest for CDS (40.8\%) and online professional journal
              access (39.0\%), and lowest for e-mail communication with
              patients (3.4\%). Ten percent of physicians never used any of the
              5 IT tools. In separate logistic regression analyses predicting
              usage of each of the 5 IT tools, the strongest associations with
              IT use were primary care practice (adjusted odds ratios [aORs]
              ranging from 1.34 to 2.26) and academic practice setting (aORs
              2.17 to 5.41). Years since medical school graduation (aOR 0.85 to
              0.87 for every 5 years after graduation) and solo/2-person
              practice setting (aORs 0.21 to 0.55) were negatively associated
              with IT use. Practice location and patient panel characteristics
              were not independently associated with IT use. CONCLUSIONS In
              early 2004, the majority of physicians did not regularly use
              basic, inexpensive, and widely available IT tools in clinical
              practice. Efforts to increase the use of IT in medicine should
              focus on practice-level barriers to adoption.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to evaluate three models that use
              information gathered during triage to predict, in real time, the
              number of emergency department (ED) patients who subsequently
              will be admitted to a hospital inpatient unit (IU) and to
              introduce a new methodology for implementing these predictions in
              the hospital setting. METHODS: Three simple methods were compared
              for predicting hospital admission at ED triage: expert opinion,
              na{\"\i}ve Bayes conditional probability, and a generalized
              linear regression model with a logit link function
              (logit-linear). Two months of data were gathered from the Boston
              VA Healthcare System's 13-bed ED, which receives approximately
              1,100 patients per month. Triage nurses were asked to estimate
              the likelihood that each of 767 triaged patients from that
              2-month period would be admitted after their ED treatment, by
              placing them into one of six categories ranging from low to high
              likelihood. Logit-linear regression and na{\"\i}ve Bayes models
              also were developed using retrospective data and used to estimate
              admission probabilities for each patient who entered the ED
              within a 2-month time frame, during triage hours (1,160
              patients). Predictors considered included patient age, primary
              complaint, provider, designation (ED or fast track), arrival
              mode, and urgency level (emergency severity index assigned at
              triage). RESULTS: Of the three methods considered, logit-linear
              regression performed the best in predicting total bed need, with
              a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve
              (AUC) of 0.887, an R(2) of 0.58, an average estimation error of
              0.19 beds per day, and on average roughly 3.5 hours before peak
              demand occurred. Significant predictors were patient age, primary
              complaint, bed type designation, and arrival mode (p < 0.0001 for
              all factors). The na{\"\i}ve Bayesian model had similar positive
              predictive value, with an AUC of 0.841 and an R(2) of 0.58, but
              with average difference in total bed need of approximately 2.08
              per day. Triage nurse expert opinion also had some predictive
              capability, with an R(2) of 0.52 and an average difference in
              total bed need of 1.87 per day. CONCLUSIONS: Simple probability
              models can reasonably predict ED-to-IU patient volumes based on
              basic data gathered at triage. This predictive information could
              be used for improved real-time bed management, patient flow, and
              discharge processes. Both statistical models were reasonably
              accurate, using only a minimal number of readily available

              dieting and restrictive eating, abnormal eating behavior, and
              finally clinical eating disorders. The prevalence of eating
              disorders is increased in elite athletes and for this group the
              cause of starting to diet is related to (a) perception of the
              paradigm of appearance in the specific sport, (b) perceived
              performance improvements, and (c) sociocultural pressures for
              thinness or an ``ideal'' body. Athletes most at risk for
              disordered eating are those involved in sports emphasizing a thin
              body size/shape, a high power-to-weight ratio, and/or sports
              utilizing weight categories, such as in some high-intensity
              sports. In addition to dieting, personality factors, pressure to
              lose weight, frequent weight cycling, early start of
              sport-specific training, overtraining, injuries, and unfortunate
              coaching behavior, are important risk factors. To prevent
              disordered eating and eating disorders, the athletes have to
              practice healthy eating, and the medical staff of teams and
              parents must be able to recognize symptoms indicating risk for
              eating disorders. Coaches and leaders must accept that disordered

              established in preclinical animal trials and human clinical
              trials. Patients with LGM have been shown to have worse clinical
              outcomes including significantly increased incidences of MACE.
              Methods Patients with significant coronary artery disease
              underwent RA?PCI in the PRECISE study (n=164) and standard M?PCI
              in the STLLR trial (n?=?1,509). Longitudinal geographic miss was
              defined as cases where the entire length of the injured or
              stenotic segment was not fully covered by the total length of the
              stent. The incidence of LGM was compared between RA?PCI and M?PCI
              cohorts. Results The RA?PCI cohort had a significantly greater
              prevalence of previous MI, previous coronary revascularization,
              and unstable angina. The robotic cohort exhibited a lower
              incidence of LGM when compared to the M?PCI patients, 12.2\% to
              43.1\%, respectively (P?<?0.0001). To account for the differences
              in baseline characteristics between the two studies, a propensity
              score analysis was conducted. The propensity modeling showed
              similar rates of LGM in both a larger group of patients that met
              key PRECISE study inclusion/exclusion criteria adjusted for
              propensity score (9.3\% vs 55.0\%; P?<?0.0001) and in a smaller,

              significantly lower incidence of LGM compared to standard M?PCI.

              and potential for positive impact. RESULTS: Forty-eight percent
              of participants observed weight-related bullying in their school
              and 99\% expressed the importance of intervening in such
              incidents. A large majority (75\%-94\%) supported 8 of the 11
              policies, especially actions requiring school-based health
              curriculum to include content on eating disorder prevention
              (94\%), and addressing weight-bullying through antibullying
              policies (92\%), staff training (89\%), and school curriculum
              (89\%). Strongly supported policies were viewed by participants
              as being the most impactful and feasible to implement.
              CONCLUSIONS: Educators recognize weight-related bullying and
              eating disorders as problems in their schools that warrant
              improved prevention and intervention efforts at the policy level.",

              behaviors have been identified as family accommodation (FA), a
              phenomenon that, if ignored, may facilitate OCD symptoms and lead
              to poorer prognosis. Because FA has been recognized as a
              predictor of treatment outcome, we examined the prevalence of FA
              and identified patient and family sociodemographic and clinical
              variables associated with FA in an outpatient sample. METHODS:
              The study comprised 228 subjects, namely, 114 patients with OCD
              and 114 family members, assessed before the patients entered a
              12-session cognitive behavioral group therapy program. A
              multivariate linear regression model was used to control for
              confounding factors and to evaluate variables independently
              associated with FA. FA was evaluated using the Family
              Accommodation Scale for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder-Interviewer
              Rated. RESULTS: FA was found to be highly prevalent among family
              members. Two patient factors positively associated with FA were
              OCD severity as measured by the Clinical Global Impressions Scale
              and higher scores on the Obsessions dimension of the

              likely preceded by the simultaneous presence of thwarted
              belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and acquired capability.
              Past research has shown that hope and optimism are negatively

              provides guidelines to guide risk assessment, treatment and
              return-to-play decisions. The IOC expert working group introduces
              a broader, more comprehensive term for the condition previously
              known as 'Female Athlete Triad'. The term 'Relative Energy
              Deficiency in Sport' (RED-S), points to the complexity involved
              and the fact that male athletes are also affected. The syndrome
              of RED-S refers to impaired physiological function including, but
              not limited to, metabolic rate, menstrual function, bone health,
              immunity, protein synthesis, cardiovascular health caused by
              relative energy deficiency. The cause of this syndrome is energy
              deficiency relative to the balance between dietary energy intake
              and energy expenditure required for health and activities of
              daily living, growth and sporting activities. Psychological
              consequences can either precede RED-S or be the result of RED-S.
              The clinical phenomenon is not a 'triad' of the three entities of
              energy availability, menstrual function and bone health, but
              rather a syndrome that affects many aspects of physiological
              function, health and athletic performance. This Consensus

              management of affected athletes. The 'Sport Risk Assessment and

              in general practice on patients' consumption of fruit and
              vegetables in adults from a low income population. DESIGN:
              Parallel group randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Primary
              health centre in a deprived, ethnically mixed inner city area.
              PARTICIPANTS: 271 patients aged 18-70 years without serious
              illness. INTERVENTION: Brief individual behavioural counselling
              based on the stage of change model; time matched nutrition
              education counselling. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self reported
              number of portions of fruit and vegetables eaten per day, plasma
              beta carotene, alpha tocopherol, and ascorbic acid
              concentrations, and 24 hour urinary potassium excretion.
              Assessment at baseline, eight weeks, and 12 months. RESULTS:
              Consumption of fruit and vegetables increased from baseline to 12
              months by 1.5 and 0.9 portions per day in the behavioural and
              nutrition groups (mean difference 0.6 portions, 95\% confidence
              interval 0.1 to 1.1). The proportion of participants eating five
              or more portions a day increased by 42\% and 27\% in the two
              groups (mean difference 15\%, 3\% to 28\%). Plasma beta carotene
              and alpha tocopherol concentrations increased in both groups, but
              the rise in beta carotene was greater in the behavioural group
              (mean difference 0.16 micromol/l, 0.001 micromol/l to 1.34
              micromol/l). There were no changes in plasma ascorbic acid
              concentrations or urinary potassium excretion. Differences were
              maintained when analysis was restricted to the 177 participants
              with incomes < or = pound 400 (596, \$640) a week. CONCLUSIONS:
              Brief individual counselling in primary care can elicit sustained
              increases in consumption of fruit and vegetables in low income
              adults in the general population.",

              reduce mortality from the disease by 20\% in high risk smokers.
              This review covers the state of the art knowledge on several
              aspects of implementing a screening program. The most important
              are to identify people who are at high enough risk to warrant
              screening and the appropriate management of lung nodules found at
              screening. An accurate risk prediction model is more efficient
              than age and pack years of smoking alone at identifying those who
              will develop lung cancer and die from the disease. Algorithms are
              available for assessing people who screen positive to determine
              who needs additional imaging or invasive investigations. Concerns
              about low dose computed tomography screening include false
              positive results, overdiagnosis, radiation exposure, and costs.
              Further work is needed to define the frequency and duration of
              screening and to refine risk prediction models so that they can
              be used to assess the risk of lung cancer in special populations.
              Another important area is the use of computer vision software
              tools to facilitate high throughput interpretation of low dose
              computed tomography images so that costs can be reduced and the
              consistency of scan interpretation can be improved. Sufficient
              data are available to support the implementation of screening
              programs at the population level in stages that can be expanded

              fibrin rich clots, the geometric clot extractor (GCE; Neuravi,
              Galway, Ireland), in an in vitro cerebrovascular occlusion stroke
              model. METHODS: After introducing fibrin rich clot analogues into
              the middle cerebral artery of the model, we compared the rates of
              recanalization between GCE and Solitaire flow restoration stent
              retriever (SR; Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA; control
              group) cases. A maximum of three passes of each device was
              allowed. If the SR failed to recanalize the vessel after three
              passes, one pass of the GCE was allowed (rescue cases). RESULTS:
              In a total of 26 thrombectomy cases (13 GCE, 13 SR), successful
              recanalization (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score of 2b
              or 3) was achieved 100\% of the time in the GCE cases with an
              average of 2.13 passes per case. This rate was significantly
              higher compared with the Solitaire recanalization rate (7.7\%,
              P<0.0001) with an average of three passes per case. After SR
              failure (in 92\% of cases), successful one pass GCE rescue

              devastating condition and leading cause of morbidity and
              mortality, affecting an estimated 800 000 people per year in the
              USA. The natural history of untreated or unrevascularized large
              vessel occlusions in acute stroke patients results in mortality
              rates approaching 30\%, with only 25\% achieving good neurologic
              outcomes at 90 days. Recently, data have demonstrated that early
              endovascular recanalization of large vessel occlusions results in
              better outcomes than medical therapy alone. However, the majority
              of patients in these studies were treated with a stent retriever
              based approach. The purpose of COMPASS is to evaluate whether
              patients treated with a direct aspiration first pass (ADAPT)
              approach have non-inferior functional outcomes to those treated
              with a stent retriever as the firstline (SRFL) approach.
              MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients who meet the inclusion and
              exclusion criteria and consent to participate will be enrolled at
              participating centers. Treatment will be randomly assigned by a
              central web based system in a 1:1 manner to treatment with either

              prespecified with details available in the statistical analysis

              nodules were issued in 2013. Since then, new information has
              become available; therefore, the guidelines have been revised to
              reflect current thinking on nodule management. The revised
              guidelines incorporate several substantive changes that reflect
              current thinking on the management of small nodules. The minimum
              threshold size for routine follow-up has been increased, and
              recommended follow-up intervals are now given as a range rather
              than as a precise time period to give radiologists, clinicians,
              and patients greater discretion to accommodate individual risk
              factors and preferences. The guidelines for solid and subsolid
              nodules have been combined in one simplified table, and specific
              recommendations have been included for multiple nodules. These
              guidelines represent the consensus of the Fleischner Society, and

              compared with human reading by thoracic radiologists. Materials
              and Methods A matched case-control sample of low-dose computed
              tomography (CT) studies in 186 participants with 4-20-mm
              noncalcified lung nodules who underwent biopsy in the National
              Lung Screening Trial (NLST) was selected. Variables used for
              matching were age, sex, smoking status, chronic obstructive
              pulmonary disease status, body mass index, study year of the
              positive screening test, and screening results. Studies before
              lung biopsy were randomly split into a training set (70 cancers
              plus 70 benign controls) and a validation set (20 cancers plus 26
              benign controls). Image features from within and outside dominant
              nodules were extracted. A CAD algorithm developed from the
              training set and a random forest classifier were applied to the
              validation set to predict biopsy outcomes. Receiver operating
              characteristic analysis was used to compare the prediction
              accuracy of CAD with the NLST investigator's diagnosis and
              readings from three experienced and board-certified thoracic
              radiologists who used contemporary clinical practice guidelines.
              Results In the validation cohort, the area under the receiver
              operating characteristic curve for CAD was 0.9154. By default,
              the sensitivity, specificity, and PPV of the NLST investigators
              were 1.00, 0.00, and 0.43, respectively. The sensitivity,
              specificity, PPV, and negative predictive value of CAD and the
              three radiologists' combined reading were 0.95, 0.88, 0.86, and
              0.96 and 0.70, 0.69, 0.64, and 0.75, respectively. Conclusion CAD
              could increase PPV and reduce the false-positive rate in the
              early diagnosis of lung cancer. \copyright{} RSNA, 2017 Online

  abstract = "Purpose To determine the feasibility of creating a clinically
              relevant hepatic ablation (ie, an ablation zone capable of
              treating a 2-cm liver tumor) by using robotically assisted sonic
              therapy (RAST), a noninvasive and nonthermal focused ultrasound
              therapy based on histotripsy. Materials and Methods This study
              was approved by the institutional animal use and care committee.
              Ten female pigs were treated with RAST in a single session with a
              prescribed 3-cm spherical treatment region and immediately
              underwent abdominal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Three pigs
              (acute group) were sacrificed immediately following MR imaging.
              Seven pigs (chronic group) were survived for approximately 4
              weeks and were reimaged with MR imaging immediately before
              sacrifice. Animals underwent necropsy and harvesting of the liver
              for histologic evaluation of the ablation zone. RAST ablations
              were performed with a 700-kHz therapy transducer. Student t tests
              were performed to compare prescribed versus achieved ablation
              diameter, difference of sphericity from 1, and change in ablation
              zone volume from acute to chronic imaging. Results Ablation zones
              had a sphericity index of 0.99 $\pm$ 0.01 (standard deviation) (P
              < .001 vs sphericity index of 1). Anteroposterior and transverse
              dimensions were not significantly different from prescribed (3.4
              $\pm$ 0.7; P = .08 and 3.2 $\pm$ 0.8; P = .29, respectively). The
              craniocaudal dimension was significantly larger than prescribed
              (3.8 $\pm$ 1.1; P = .04), likely because of respiratory motion.
              The central ablation zone demonstrated complete cell destruction
              and a zone of partial necrosis. A fibrous capsule surrounded the
              ablation zone by 4 weeks. On 4-week follow-up images, ablation
              zone volumes decreased by 64\% (P < .001). Conclusion RAST is
              capable of producing clinically relevant ablation zones in a
              noninvasive manner in a porcine model. \copyright{} RSNA, 2018.",

              in 2011, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force made lung cancer
              screening (LCS) with low-dose computed tomography (CT) a public
              health recommendation in 2013. The Centers for Medicare and
              Medicaid Services (CMS) currently reimburse LCS for asymptomatic
              individuals aged 55-77 years who have a tobacco smoking history
              of at least 30 pack-years and who are either currently smoking or
              had quit less than 15 years earlier. Commercial insurers
              reimburse the cost of LCS for individuals aged 55-80 years with
              the same smoking history. Effective care for the millions of
              Americans who qualify for LCS requires an organized step-wise
              approach. The 10-pillar model reflects the elements required to
              support a successful LCS program: eligibility, education,
              examination ordering, image acquisition, image review,
              communication, referral network, quality improvement,
              reimbursement, and research frontiers. Examination ordering can
              be coupled with decision support to ensure that only eligible
              individuals undergo LCS. Communication of results revolves around
              the Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) from the
              American College of Radiology. Lung-RADS is a structured
              decision-oriented reporting system designed to minimize the rate
              of false-positive screening examination results. With nodule size

              management pathways to the variety of nodules present on LCS CT
              studies. Tracking of patient outcomes is facilitated by a
              CMS-approved national registry maintained by the American College

              diagnostic and therapeutic procedures (interventional

              conducted. The questionnaires were completed by 62\% (n=355) of
              573 possible participants. Of the respirologists who responded,
              69.2\% were younger than 50 years of age, 70.3\% had been in
              practice for fewer than 20 years, 64.4\% were in full- or
              part-time academic practice, and 72.9\% were based in urban
              centres with a catchment population of more than 250,000. The
              current ratio of respirologists to population in Canada, assuming
              a total population of 31,000,000, is 1:54,101. In the present
              survey, only 68.3\% respirologists practised clinical respirology
              for 50\% or more of their time, and half (49.5\%) of
              respirologists devoted more than 50\% of their time on
              nonrespirology or nonclinical activities. Thus, the more precise

              laser, cryotherapy and stents (8.7\%), transthoracic needle
              biopsy (22.2\%) and thoracoscopy (11.3\%). Because 97\% of

              the regulation of emotions. We argue that mindfulness has
              achieved effective outcomes in the treatment of anxiety,
              depression, and other psychopathologies through the contribution
              of mindfulness to emotional regulation. We consider the unique
              factors that mindfulness meditation brings to the process of
              emotion regulation that may account for its effectiveness. We
              review experimental evidence that points towards the unique

              Objectives: To investigate trends in tracheostomy use, timing,
              and outcomes in the United States., Methods: We calculated
              estimates of tracheostomy use and outcomes from the National
              Inpatient Sample from 1993 to 2012. We used hierarchical models
              to determine factors associated with tracheostomy use among MV
              patients., Measurements and Main Results: We identified 1,352,432
              adults who received tracheostomy from 1993 to 2012 (9.1\% of MV
              patients). Tracheostomy was more common in surgical patients,
              men, and racial/ethnic minorities. Age-adjusted incidence of
              tracheostomy increased by 106\%, rising disproportionately to MV
              use. Among MV patients, tracheostomy rose from 6.9\% in 1993 to
              9.8\% in 2008, and then it declined to 8.7\% in 2012 (P <
              0.0001). Increases in tracheostomy use were driven by surgical
              patients (9.5\% in 1993; 15.0\% in 2012; P < 0.0001), with little
              change among nonsurgical patients (5.8\% in 1993; 5.9\% in 2012;
              P < 0.0001). Over time, tracheostomies were performed earlier
              (median, 11 d in 1998; 10 d in 2012; P < 0.0001), whereas
              hospital length of stay declined (median, 39 d in 1993; 26 d in
              2012; P < 0.0001), discharges to long-term facilities increased
              (40.1\% vs. 71.9\%; P < 0.0001), and hospital mortality declined
              (38.1\% vs. 14.7\%; P < 0.0001)., Conclusions: Over the past two
              decades, tracheostomy use rose substantially in the United States
              until 2008, when use began to decline. The observed dramatic
              increase in discharge of tracheostomy patients to long-term care

              tomography (CT) is lacking. OBJECTIVES: To examine recent trends
              in pulmonary nodule identification. METHODS: We used electronic
              health records and natural language processing to identify
              members of an integrated health system who had nodules measuring
              4 to 30 mm. We calculated rates of chest CT imaging, nodule
              identification, and receipt of a new lung cancer diagnosis within
              2 years of nodule identification, and standardized rates by age
              and sex to estimate the frequency of nodule identification in the
              U.S. population in 2010. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Between
              2006 and 2012, more than 200,000 adult members underwent 415,581
              chest CT examinations. The annual frequency of chest CT imaging
              increased from 1.3 to 1.9\% for all adult members, whereas the
              frequency of nodule identification increased from 24 to 31\% for
              all scans performed. The annual rate of chest CT increased from
              15.4 to 20.7 per 1,000 person-years, and the rate of nodule
              identification increased from 3.9 to 6.6 per 1,000 person-years,
              whereas the rate of a new lung cancer diagnosis remained stable.
              By extrapolation, more than 4.8 million Americans underwent at
              least one chest CT scan and 1.57 million had a nodule identified,
              including 63,000 who received a new lung cancer diagnosis within
              2 years. CONCLUSIONS: Incidental pulmonary nodules are an
              increasingly common consequence of routine medical care, with an
              incidence that is much greater than recognized previously. More
              frequent nodule identification has not been accompanied by

              risk, and those who continue to smoke after diagnosis have a
              worse survival. Screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed
              tomography (LDCT) reduces mortality in high-risk individuals.
              Smoking cessation is an essential component of a high-quality
              screening program. OBJECTIVES: To quantify the effects of smoking
              history and abstinence on mortality in high-risk individuals who
              participated in the NLST (National Lung Screening Trial).
              METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled
              trial (NLST). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Measurements
              included self-reported demographics, medical and smoking history,
              and lung cancer-specific and all-cause mortality. Cox regression
              was used to study the association of mortality with smoking
              status and pack-years. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were examined
              for differences in survival based on trial arm and smoking
              status. Current smokers had an increased lung cancer-specific
              (hazard ratio [HR], 2.14-2.29) and all-cause mortality (HR,
              1.79-1.85) compared with former smokers irrespective of screening
              arm. Former smokers in the control arm abstinent for 7 years had
              a 20\% mortality reduction comparable with the benefit reported
              with LDCT screening in the NLST. The maximum benefit was seen
              with the combination of smoking abstinence at 15 years and LDCT
              screening, which resulted in a 38\% reduction in lung
              cancer-specific mortality (HR, 0.62; 95\% confidence interval,
              0.51-0.76). CONCLUSIONS: Seven years of smoking abstinence
              reduced lung cancer-specific mortality at a magnitude comparable
              with LDCT screening. This reduction was greater when abstinence
              was combined with screening, highlighting the importance of

              increased emphasis in both academia and industry. More than 50
              years of research in creativity indicates that creativity is key
              to product and service innovation. Nevertheless, there is
              scarcely any comprehensive review dedicated to appraising the
              complex construct of creativity, the underlying cognitive
              process, and the role of creativity in product and service
              development. Method: We review relevant literature regarding
              creativity, creative cognition, and the engineering design
              process to appraise the role of creativity in ergonomic design
              and to construct a conceptual model of creative product and
              service development. Results: A framework of ergodesign
              creativity is advanced that highlights the central role of
              creativity in synergistically addressing the four dimensions of
              ergonomic design: functionality, safety, usability, and
              affectivity. A conceptual model of creative design process is
              then constructed that is goal oriented and is initiated by active
              problem finding and problem formulating. This process is carried
              out in a recursive and dynamic way, facilitated by creative
              thinking strategies. Conclusion: It is proposed that ergodesign
              creativity can add supplemental value to products and services,
              which subsequently affects consumer behavior and helps
              organizations gain competitive advantage. Application: The

              consulted. This resulted in a database of dynamic arm supports.
              Product information was added, and the devices were categorized.
              RESULTS: A total of 104 dynamic arm supports were found. These
              could be categorized as nonactuated devices (N = 39), passively
              actuated devices (N = 24), actively actuated devices (N = 34), or
              devices using the functional electrical stimulation principle (N
              = 7). Functionality analysis resulted in second-level
              categorization: tremor suppression, facilitation of anti-gravity
              movement, and assistance of specific joint motion. CONCLUSION:
              All devices could be ordered in a categorization of low
              complexity. Many have been developed; most have disappeared and
              have been succeeded by similar devices. Limitations of the
              devices found mainly concern interfacing and the range of motion
              facilitated. Future devices could make use of whatever residual
              strength is available in the users' arm for control. CLINICAL
              RELEVANCE: The provided overview of devices in this article and
              the classification developed is relevant for practitioners
              seeking assistive solutions for their clients as it makes the
              range of developed solutions both accessible and comprehensible.",

              degree to which transgender individuals feel genuine, authentic,
              and comfortable with their gender identity and external
              appearance. In Study 1, the Transgender Congruence scale (TCS)
              was developed, and data from 162 transgender individuals were
              used to estimate the reliability and validity of its scores. Two
              factors emerged: Appearance Congruence and Gender Identity
              Acceptance. TCS total and subscale scores were internally
              consistent. Supporting its construct validity, TCS scores were
              (a) positively related to life satisfaction and presence of life
              meaning; (b) negatively related to anxiety, depression, and body
              dissatisfaction; and (c) unrelated to social desirability and
              searching for life's meaning. TCS scores also garnered
              incremental validity by predicting life satisfaction, presence of
              meaning in life, anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms above
              and beyond the number of steps taken to transition. Study 2
              confirmed the TCS's factor structure with a sample of 342
              transgender individuals. The final 12-item TCS is a

              psychotherapeutic interventions require culturally competent
              delivery for ethnoracial minority clients to protect the
              distinctive cultural orientations of these clients. Dominant
              disciplinary conceptualizations of cultural competence are ``kind
              of person'' models that emphasize specialized awareness,
              knowledge, and skills on the part of the practitioner. Even
              within psychology, this approach to cultural competence is
              controversial owing to professional misgivings concerning its
              culturally essentialist assumptions. Unfortunately, alternative
              ``process-oriented'' models of cultural competence emphasize such
              generic aspects of therapeutic interaction that they remain in
              danger of losing sight of culture altogether. Thus, for cultural
              competence to persist as a meaningful construct, an alternative
              approach that avoids both essentialism and generalism must be
              recovered. One means to capture this alternative is to shift
              focus away from culturally competent therapists toward culturally
              commensurate therapies. Indigenous communities in North America
              represent interesting sites for exploring this shift, owing to
              widespread political commitments to Aboriginal cultural
              reclamation in the context of postcoloniality. Two examples from
              indigenous communities illustrate a continuum of cultural
              commensurability that ranges from global psychotherapeutic
              approaches at one end to local healing traditions at the other.
              Location of culturally integrative efforts by indigenous
              communities along this continuum illustrates the possibility for
              local, agentic, and intentional deconstructions and

              interpretive inquiry, five reintegration counsellors participated
              in semi-structured interviews about their work experiences.
              Thematic analysis indicated that hope played an important role in

              thoracic endovascular repair (TEVAR) of blunt thoracic aortic
              injuries (BTAIs). Late results remain ill-defined. The purpose of
              this study is to review the midterm results of our experience

              analysis was performed reviewing all endovascular repairs of
              BTAIs from 2002 to present. Preoperative, operative, and
              postoperative variables were recorded. Clinical end points
              included aortic-related mortality, stroke and paraplegia,
              hospital length of stay, procedure-related complications,
              endoleaks, and reinterventions. Computed tomography data sets
              were postprocessed for assessing integrity of stent grafts and
              late complications. RESULTS: A total of 24 cases of BTAIs treated
              with TEVAR were identified. Thoracic endovascular repair was
              successful in treating BTAIs in all patients and there were no
              instances of procedure-related death, stroke, or paraplegia. One
              access complication occurred, requiring an iliofemoral bypass.
              Actuarial survival estimates and freedom from reintervention at 5
              years were 88.7\% and 95.8\%, respectively. No late endoleaks,
              stent fractures, or device migration were identified. One patient
              required a secondary intervention 1 year following the initial
              repair to treat a pseudocoarctation syndrome caused by a
              diaphragm at the distal half of the stented aorta. This was
              treated successfully with repeated endografting. CONCLUSIONS:
              Thoracic endovascular repair for BTAIs can be performed safely
              with low periprocedural mortality and morbidity. Midterm

              coil insertion force could be smaller and more stable when the
              coil delivery wire is driven mechanically at a constant speed.
              Another background is the difficulty in synchronizing operators'
              minds and hands when two operators control the microcatheter and
              the coil respectively. We have therefore developed a mechanical
              coil insertion system enabling a single operator to insert coils
              at a fixed speed while controlling the microcatheter. Using our
              new system, the operator manipulated the microcatheter with both
              hands and drove the coil using foot switches simultaneously. A
              delivery wire force sensor previously reported was used
              concurrently, allowing the operator to detect excessive stress on
              the wire. In vitro coil embolization was performed using three
              methods: simple mechanical advance of the coil; simple mechanical
              advance of the coil with microcatheter control; and driving
              (forward and backward) of the coil using foot switches in
              addition to microcatheter control. The system worked without any
              problems, and did not interfere with any procedures. In
              experimental coil embolization, delivery wire control using the
              foot switches as well as microcatheter manipulation helped to
              achieve successful insertion of coils. This system could offer
              the possibility of developing safer and more efficient coil
              embolization. Although we aim at total mechanization and
              automation of procedures in the future, microcatheter
              manipulation and synchronized delivery wire control are still
              indispensable using this system.",

              assistants. The results are presented in five themes:
              independence in the meal situation, motivation to use the eating
              aid, functions of the eating aid, social aspects of using the
              eating aid, and design corresponding to intellectual disability.
              The eating aid's function, user-friendliness, and the assistants'
              attitudes appear to be crucial for using the eating aid. Another
              important aspect is the introductory and training phase, which
              must be fundamentally adapted to suit the PWIDs ability to learn
              and understand. When these aspects are controlled, the eating aid
              can be a tool for increased independence during meal situations

  abstract = "Emotion regulation has been conceptualized as a process by which
              individuals modify their emotional experiences, expressions, and
              physiology and the situations eliciting such emotions in order to
              produce appropriate responses to the ever-changing demands posed
              by the environment. Thus, context plays a central role in emotion
              regulation. This is particularly relevant to the work on emotion
              regulation in psychopathology, because psychological disorders
              are characterized by rigid responses to the environment. However,
              this recognition of the importance of context has appeared
              primarily in the theoretical realm, with the empirical work
              lagging behind. In this review, the author proposes an approach
              to systematically evaluate the contextual factors shaping emotion
              regulation. Such an approach consists of specifying the
              components that characterize emotion regulation and then
              systematically evaluating deviations within each of these
              components and their underlying dimensions. Initial guidelines
              for how to combine such dimensions and components in order to
              capture substantial and meaningful contextual influences are
              presented. This approach is offered to inspire theoretical and
              empirical work that it is hoped will result in the development of

              varies considerably in approach. The aim of our study was to
              evaluate the need for intraoperative bronchoscopy and to compare
              various surgical techniques. Methods: During 1 year all
              percutaneous tracheostomies in three intensive care units were
              prospectively documented according to a unified protocol. In one
              unit, bronchoscopy was used routinely and in others only during
              the study. Results: A total of 111 subjects (77 males) with
              median age 64 (range, 18--86) years and body mass index 25.4
              (range, 15.9--50.7) were included. In unit A, tracheal wall was
              directly exposed; in unit B, limited dissection to enable
              tracheal palpation was made. In both units, bronchoscopy was used
              to check the location of an already inserted guiding needle;
              needle position required correction in 8\% and 12\% of cases,
              respectively. In unit C, in tracheostomies without pretracheal
              tissue dissection, bronchoscopy was used to guide needle
              insertion; needle position required correction in 66\% of cases.
              Median duration of operations performed by thoracic surgeons and
              residents was 10 (range, 3--37) min and by intensive care doctors
              and residents was 16.5 (range, 3--63) min (p < 0.001). Time from
              the beginning of preparations for tracheostomy until the end of
              the whole procedure was median 32 min for bedside tracheostomies
              and 64 min for operations in the operating theatre (p < 0.001).
              Conclusion: Limited pretracheal tissue dissection enabled proper
              guiding needle insertion and bronchoscopy was rarely needed.
              Percutaneous tracheostomies performed by thoracic surgeons took
              less time, and duration of the whole procedure was remarkably
              shorter when performed at bedside.",

              Current guidelines are concerned primarily with safety aspects of
              the procedure. In view of this, and the authors' own observations
              of individual variation in preparation and technique, a national
              survey of bronchoscopic procedure was performed to assess
              physicians' methods. A structured questionnaire was mailed to 547

              routines of patient preparation, drug therapy, sampling methods,
              and experience of complications with the flexible bronchoscope
              were assessed. A 60\% response (328 physicians) was obtained.
              Patient consent was obtained by a junior doctor in 31\% of
              replies. 205 (63\%) physicians gave benzodiazepine sedation, 46
              (14\%) used opioid, and 38 (12\%) administered both. Ninety-four
              (29\%) physicians prescribed an antimuscarinic agent, and 235
              (74\%) gave antibiotics to patients with mechanical heart valves.
              Only 22\% of physicians monitored electrocardiogram and 10\%
              monitored blood pressure during all procedures. Marked variance
              was noted in sampling routines of suspected lung tumours.
              Physicians who used fluoroscopic guidance for transbronchial lung

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The evaluation of more than one intervention in the
              same randomised controlled trial can be achieved using a parallel
              group design. However this requires increased sample size and can
              be inefficient, especially if there is also interest in
              considering combinations of the interventions. An alternative may
              be a factorial trial, where for two interventions participants
              are allocated to receive neither intervention, one or the other,
              or both. Factorial trials require special considerations,
              however, particularly at the design and analysis stages.
              DISCUSSION: Using a 2 x 2 factorial trial as an example, we
              present a number of issues that should be considered when
              planning a factorial trial. The main design issue is that of
              sample size. Factorial trials are most often powered to detect
              the main effects of interventions, since adequate power to detect
              plausible interactions requires greatly increased sample sizes.
              The main analytical issues relate to the investigation of main
              effects and the interaction between the interventions in
              appropriate regression models. Presentation of results should
              reflect the analytical strategy with an emphasis on the principal
              research questions. We also give an example of how baseline and
              follow-up data should be presented. Lastly, we discuss the
              implications of the design, analytical and presentational issues
              covered. SUMMARY: Difficulties in interpreting the results of
              factorial trials if an influential interaction is observed is the
              cost of the potential for efficient, simultaneous consideration
              of two or more interventions. Factorial trials can in principle
              be designed to have adequate power to detect realistic
              interactions, and in any case they are the only design that
              allows such effects to be investigated.",

              and their offspring. Micronutrient supplements are recommended

              for the offspring, but their potential beneficial effects on

              the risk for symptoms of postpartum depression in a longitudinal
              pregnancy cohort from the Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and
              Nutrition (APrON) study. METHODS: Participants came from a cohort
              of the first 600 APrON women. Supplemental nutrient intake and
              symptoms of depression (measured with the Edinburgh Postnatal
              Depression Scale (EPDS)) were collected at each trimester and 12
              weeks postpartum. RESULTS: Of the 475 participants who completed
              the EPDS at least twice in pregnancy and at 12 weeks postpartum,
              416 (88\%) scored <10 and 59 (12\%) scored $\geq$10, where an
              EPDS $\geq$10 is considered to be ``at least probable minor
              depression''. Mean nutrient intakes from supplements were higher
              in women with lower EPDS scores, particularly selenium (p =
              0.0015) and omega-3s (p = 0.01). Bivariate analyses showed that
              several demographic and social/lifestyle variables were
              associated with EPDS $\geq$10: not having been born in Canada (p
              = 0.01), greater number of chronic conditions (p = 0.05), greater
              number of stressful life events during this pregnancy (p = 0.02),
              and lower prenatal and postnatal support (p = 0.0043 and p =
              0.0001, respectively). Adjusting for covariates and nutrients
              known to be associated with postpartum depression, logistic
              regression showed that having a prenatal EPDS $\geq$ 10 increased
              the odds of postpartum depressive symptoms (second and third
              trimester OR = 3.29, 95\% CI = 1.55 - 7.01, p = 0.004 and OR =
              4.26, 95\% CI = 2.05 - 8.85, p < 0.0001, respectively), while
              prenatal supplemental selenium (per 10 mcg, OR = 0.76, 95\% CI =
              0.74 - 0.78, p = 0.0019) and postnatal social support (OR = 0.87,
              95\% CI = 0.78 - 0.97, p = 0.0015) were protective. CONCLUSIONS:
              Multiple factors, including supplementary selenium intake, are
              associated with the risk of postpartum depressive symptoms.

              disorders, it is necessary to investigate their subtypes and
              develop specific assessment tools to measure their specific
              symptoms. Orthorexia nervosa is an alleged eating disorder in
              which the person is excessively preoccupied with healthy food.
              The ORTO-15, designed by Donini and colleagues, is the first and
              only at least partially validated instrument to measure this
              construct. The aims of the present study were to examine the
              psychometric properties of its Hungarian adaptation (ORTO-11-Hu),
              and to investigate its relationship to food consumption and
              lifestyle habits in order to contribute to a better description
              of the phenomenon. METHODS: The ORTO-11-Hu, a lifestyle habits
              questionnaire, a food choice list indicating foods the
              participants choose to consume, and ten additional
              orthorexia-related questions were administered to a group of 810
              Hungarian participants (89.4\% female) aged between 20 and 70 (M
              = 32.39 $\pm$ 10.37 years). RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis
              suggested a single factor structure for the 11-item shortened
              version of the instrument. Internal consistency of the measure
              was adequate (Cronbach's alpha = 0.82). No significant
              differences were found between males and females on the
              ORTO-11-Hu. Age and body mass index were significantly associated
              with a tendency towards orthorexia nervosa. Additional
              orthorexia-related features were significantly correlated with
              ORTO-11-Hu scores: orthorexia nervosa tendency was associated not
              only with healthier food choices (eating more whole wheat
              cereals, less white wheat cereals, more fruit and vegetables) but
              with shopping in health food stores, as well as with some healthy
              lifestyle habits (more sports activity, specific dietary
              behaviors, and less alcohol intake). Individuals with higher
              orthorexia nervosa tendency also reported a greater tendency to
              advocate their healthy diet to their friends and family members.
              CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence for the reliability
              of ORTO-11-Hu and some support for the construct validity of the
              instrument. The present study also contributes to the

              due to increasing incidence and poor survival rates. In recent
              years, advances in the treatment of metastatic NSCLC have
              resulted from the introduction of targeted therapies. However,
              the application of these new agents increases treatment costs
              considerably. The objective of this article is to review the
              economic evidence of targeted therapies in metastatic NSCLC.
              METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify
              cost-effectiveness (CE) as well as cost-utility studies. Medline,
              Embase, SciSearch, Cochrane, and 9 other databases were searched
              from 2000 through April 2013 (including update) for full-text
              publications. The quality of the studies was assessed via the
              validated Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) instrument.
              RESULTS: Nineteen studies (including update) involving the MoAb
              bevacizumab and the Tyrosine-kinase inhibitors erlotinib and
              gefitinib met all inclusion criteria. The majority of studies

              Care (BSC) can be considered cost-effective. In comparison to
              docetaxel, erlotinib is likely to be cost-effective in subsequent
              treatment regimens as well. The insights for bevacizumab are
              miscellaneous. There are findings that gefitinib is
              cost-effective in first- and second-line treatment, however,
              based on only two studies. The role of pharmacogenomic testing
              needs to be evaluated. Therefore, future research should improve
              the available evidence and consider pharmacogenomic profiling as
              specified by the European Medicines Agency. Upcoming agents like
              crizotinib and afatinib need to be analyzed as well.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Nutrition is often a casualty of the busy work day
              for physicians. We aimed to explore physicians' views of their
              nutrition in the workplace including their perceptions of the
              impact of inadequate nutrition upon their personal wellness and
              their professional performance. METHODS: This is a qualitative
              study of a sample of 20 physicians practicing in a large urban
              teaching hospital. Semi-structured open ended interviews were
              conducted to explore physicians' views of workplace nutrition.
              The same physicians had agreed to participate in a related
              nutrition based wellness intervention study that compared
              nutritional intake and cognitive function during a day of usual
              nutrition patterns against another day with scheduled nutrition
              breaks. A second set of interviews was conducted after the
              intervention study to explore how participation in the
              intervention impacted these views. Detailed interview content
              notes were transcribed and analyzed independently with
              differences reconciled by discussion. RESULTS: At initial
              interview, participants reported difficulty accessing adequate
              nutrition at work, linking this deficit with emotional (irritable
              and frustrated), physical (tired and hungry), and cognitive
              (difficulty concentrating and poor decision making) symptoms. In
              addition to identifying practical barriers such as lack of time
              to stop and eat, inconvenient access to food and poor food
              choices, the physicians described how their sense of
              professionalism and work ethic also hinder their work nutrition
              practices. After participating in the intervention, most
              physicians reported heightened awareness of their nutrition
              patterns and intentions to improve their workplace nutrition.
              CONCLUSIONS: Physicians report that inadequate workplace
              nutrition has a significant negative impact on their personal
              wellness and professional performance. Given this threat to
              health care delivery, health care organizations and the medical
              profession need to address both the practical and professional
              barriers identified.",

              measurement has traditionally focused on symptom reduction rather
              than functioning or quality of life (QoL). Generic QoL measures
              lack sensitivity for some diagnoses and many not be responsive in
              eating disorder patients. This article describes the development
              and validation of a condition-specific QoL measure for
              adolescents and adults with eating disorders--the Eating
              Disorders Quality of Life Scale (EDQLS). METHODS: Multi-source
              and multi-stage methods were used to develop the EDQLS, with
              participation of patients with EDs, their family members and ED
              treatment providers. Sources for domain and item development
              included 39 articles, 12 patient and 10 treatment provider
              interviews, and 31 first person narratives from the internet.
              Four stages of validation and pre-testing involving 17 patients,
              10 family members and 18 providers reduced 233 items to 40 items
              in 12 domains. These items were pilot tested in 41 ED patients.
              RESULTS: The final instrument was then validated in a 12 site
              sample of 171 individuals aged 14-60 with EDs. All items showed
              good dispersion. The total raw mean score was 110 out of 200 (SD
              27.6) with higher scores indicating better QoL. Internal
              consistency was excellent (Cronbach's alpha = .96) and subscale
              internal consistency ranged from alpha .36 to .79 providing
              evidence for a strong overall construct and some
              multi-dimensionality. Validity was supported by significant
              differences in mean EDQLS according to severity levels on the
              EDI-2 (F = 95.3, p <.001) and the BSI (F = 86.9, p <.001). EDQLS
              scores were positively associated with time in treatment (F =
              4.65, p = .01) suggesting responsiveness. A strong positive
              association was also found between EDQLS scores and stage of
              change (F = 15.1 p <.001). Pearson's correlations between the
              EDQLS and criterion instrument scores were .71 for the SF-12
              mental subscale, .61 for the QoLI and .78 for the 16D, supporting
              construct validity. Exploratory principal components and item
              response theory analyses identified only a few poor fitting
              items. CONCLUSION: The EDQLS has promising psychometric

              Quality of Life Scale (EDQLS) was recently developed to allow for

              the EDQLS in a longitudinal multi-site study. METHODS: The EDQLS
              and comparator generic QoL scales were collected in person at
              baseline, and 3 and 6 months from 130 participants (mean age 25.6
              years; range 14-60) in 12 treatment programs in four Canadian
              provinces. Total score differences across the time points and
              responsiveness were examined using both anchor- and
              distribution-based methods. RESULTS: 98 (75\%) and 85 (65\%)
              responses were received at 3 and 6 months respectively. No
              statistically significant differences were found between the
              baseline sample and those lost to follow-up on any measured
              characteristic. Mean EDQLS total scores increased from 110 (SD =
              24) to 124.5 (SD = 29) at 3 months and 129 (SD = 28) at 6 months,
              and the difference by time was tested using a general linear
              model (GLM) to account for repeated measurement (p < .001).
              Responsiveness was good overall (Cohen's d = .61 and .80), and
              confirmed using anchor methods across 5 levels of self-reported
              improvement in health status (p < .001). Effect sizes across time
              were moderate or large for for all age groups. Internal
              consistency (Chronbach's alpha=.96) held across measurement
              points and patterns of responsiveness held across subscales.
              EDQLS responsiveness exceeded that of the Quality of Life
              Inventory, the Short Form-12 (mental and physical subscales) and
              was similar to the 16-dimension quality of life scale.
              CONCLUSIONS: The EDQLS is responsive to change in geographically
              diverse and clinically heterogeneous programs over a relatively
              short time period in adolescents and adults. It shows promise as
              an outcome measure for both research and clinical practice.",

              evidence-based recommendations for it are lacking. This paper
              reviewed the scientific literature relevant to competition
              preparation on nutrition and supplementation, resulting in the
              following recommendations. Caloric intake should be set at a
              level that results in bodyweight losses of approximately 0.5 to
              1\%/wk to maximize muscle retention. Within this caloric intake,
              most but not all bodybuilders will respond best to consuming
              2.3-3.1 g/kg of lean body mass per day of protein, 15-30\% of
              calories from fat, and the reminder of calories from
              carbohydrate. Eating three to six meals per day with a meal
              containing 0.4-0.5 g/kg bodyweight of protein prior and
              subsequent to resistance training likely maximizes any
              theoretical benefits of nutrient timing and frequency. However,
              alterations in nutrient timing and frequency appear to have
              little effect on fat loss or lean mass retention. Among popular
              supplements, creatine monohydrate, caffeine and beta-alanine
              appear to have beneficial effects relevant to contest
              preparation, however others do not or warrant further study. The
              practice of dehydration and electrolyte manipulation in the final
              days and hours prior to competition can be dangerous, and may not
              improve appearance. Increasing carbohydrate intake at the end of
              preparation has a theoretical rationale to improve appearance,
              however it is understudied. Thus, if carbohydrate loading is
              pursued it should be practiced prior to competition and its
              benefit assessed individually. Finally, competitors should be
              aware of the increased risk of developing eating and body image
              disorders in aesthetic sport and therefore should have access to
              the appropriate mental health professionals.",

              difficulties in recruiting enough patients for conventional
              frequentist statistical analyses to provide an appropriate
              answer. These trials are often necessary for the study of rare
              diseases as well as specific study populations e.g. children. It
              has been estimated that there are between 6,000 and 8,000 rare
              diseases that cover a broad range of diseases and patients. In
              the European Union these diseases affect up to 30 million people,
              with about 50\% of those affected being children. Therapies for
              treating these rare diseases need their efficacy and safety
              evaluated but due to the small number of potential trial
              participants, a standard randomised controlled trial is often not
              feasible. There are a number of alternative trial designs to the
              usual parallel group design, each of which offers specific
              advantages, but they also have specific limitations. Thus the
              choice of the most appropriate design is not simple. METHODS:
              PubMed was searched to identify publications about the
              characteristics of different trial designs that can be used in
              randomised, comparative small clinical trials. In addition, the
              contents tables from 11 journals were hand-searched. An algorithm
              was developed using decision nodes based on the characteristics
              of the identified trial designs. RESULTS: We identified 75
              publications that reported the characteristics of 12 randomised,
              comparative trial designs that can be used in for the evaluation
              of therapies in orphan diseases. The main characteristics and the
              advantages and limitations of these designs were summarised and
              used to develop an algorithm that may be used to help select an
              appropriate design for a given clinical situation. We used
              examples from publications of given disease-treatment-outcome
              situations, in which the investigators had used a particular
              trial design, to illustrate the use of the algorithm for the

              small proportion of Aboriginal youth have contact with mental

              health problems. The panel varied in size across the three
              sequential rounds, from 37-41 participants. Panellists were
              presented with statements about cultural considerations and
              communication strategies via online questionnaires and were
              encouraged to suggest additional content. All statements endorsed

              RESULTS: From a total of 304 statements shown to the panel of

              was 85.8\%, the overall incidence of complications was 22.0\%,
              the incidence of hypotension 7.3\% and that of hypoxia 5.3\%.
              Multiple endotracheal intubation attempts were associated with an
              increased overall incidence of complications. No airway
              management related deaths occurred. Discussion The overall
              incidence of successful pre-hospital endotracheal intubations
              compares to those found in other physician-staffed pre-hospital
              systems. The incidence of pre-hospital endotracheal intubations
              requiring more than one attempt is higher than suspected. The
              incidence of hypotension or hypoxia after pre-hospital rapid
              sequence intubation compares to those found in UK emergency
              departments. Conclusion Pre-hospital advanced airway management
              including pre-hospital endotracheal intubation performed by
              experienced anaesthesiologists is associated with high success
              rates and relatively low incidences of complications. An
              increased first pass success rate following pre-hospital
              endotracheal intubation may further reduce the incidence of
              complications and enhance patient safety in our system.",

  abstract = "Weight-control behaviour is commonly observed in a wide range of
              elite sports, especially leanness sports, where control over body
              weight is crucial for high peak performance. Nonetheless, there
              is only a fine line between purely functional behaviour and
              clinically relevant eating disorders. Especially the rapid form
              of weight manipulation seems to foster later eating disorders. So
              far, most studies have focussed on adult athletes and
              concentrated on manifest eating disorders. In contrast, our
              review concentrates on young athletes and weight-control
              behaviour as a risk factor for eating disorders. An electronic
              search according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for
              Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) Statement was performed
              using Pubmed, PsychInfo and Spolit. The following search terms
              were used: weight-control, weight-control behaviour, weight gain,
              weight loss, pathogenic weight-control behaviour and
              weight-concerns, each of them combined with elite athlete, young
              elite athlete, adolescent elite athlete and elite sports.
              Overall, data are inconsistent. In general, athletes do not seem
              to be at a higher risk for pathogenic weight concerns and
              weight-control behaviour. It does seem to be more prevalent in
              leanness sports, though. There is evidence for pathogenic
              weight-control behaviour in both genders; male athletes mostly
              trying to gain weight whereas females emphasise weight reduction.
              There is not enough data to make predictions about connections
              with age of onset. Young elite athletes do show weight-control
              behaviour with varying degrees of frequency and severity. In
              particular, leanness sports seem to be a risk factor for weight
              manipulation. Further research is needed for more details and

              physical disability. Most people with spastic CP are born with
              it, but early diagnosis is challenging, and no current biomarker
              platform readily identifies affected individuals. The aim of this
              study was to evaluate epigenetic profiles as biomarkers for
              spastic CP. A novel analysis pipeline was employed to assess DNA
              methylation patterns between peripheral blood cells of adolescent
              subjects (14.9 $\pm$ 0.3 years old) with spastic CP and controls
              at single CpG site resolution. RESULTS: Significantly hypo- and
              hyper-methylated CpG sites associated with spastic CP were
              identified. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling fully
              discriminated the CP group from the controls. Machine learning
              based classification modeling indicated a high potential for a
              diagnostic model, and 252 sets of 40 or fewer CpG sites achieved
              near-perfect accuracy within our adolescent cohorts. A pilot test
              on significantly younger subjects (4.0 $\pm$ 1.5 years old)
              identified subjects with 73\% accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent
              patients with spastic CP can be distinguished from a non-CP
              cohort based on DNA methylation patterns in peripheral blood
              cells. A clinical diagnostic test utilizing a panel of CpG sites
              may be possible using a simulated classification model. A pilot
              validation test on patients that were more than 10 years younger
              than the main adolescent cohorts indicated that distinguishing
              methylation patterns are present earlier in life. This study is

              has received very little attention despite clinical observations

              1) to assess orthorexic behaviours, eating disorder pathology and
              attitudinal body image in ED patients; 2) to identify possible
              predictors of orthorexia nervosa among ED patients. METHODS:
              Fifty-two women diagnosed with EDs were recruited. Patients'
              assessment included the following: the ORTO-15 test (Polish
              version) for orthorexic behaviours; the Eating Attitude Test-26
              (EAT-26) to identify ED symptoms; the Multidimensional Body-Self
              Relations Questionnaire (Polish version) to assess body image.
              RESULTS: A latent class analysis was performed and differences
              between identified classes were assessed. The main differences
              concerned weight, ED pathology and orthorexic behaviours within
              the same group of ED patients. In order to examine predictors of
              orthorexia nervosa, we investigated a structural equation model,
              which excellently fitted to the data ($\chi$ (2) (17) = 23.05; p
              = .148; CFI = .962; RMSEA = .08; p = .25; SRMR = .05). In ED

              pathology, weight concern, health orientation and appearance
              orientation. CONCLUSION: The assessment of the orthorexia
              construct in EDs may add to the paucity of studies about this
              issue and may help to clarify the relationship between the two.
              Differences and similarities seem to exist between these
              disorders, and may benefit from specific treatment approaches.

              these lesions requires surgery, computed tomography (CT)-guided
              biopsy or bronchoscopic interventions. Bronchoscopic
              interventions are preferable because they have lower
              complications and often patients may not be ideal candidates for
              surgical or CT-guided biopsy. In addition, guidelines recommend
              diagnosis and staging in one single procedure. The diagnostic

              for PDT was prolonged mechanical ventilation. Tracheostomies were
              most frequently performed between 7--15 days after ICU admission.
              Volume control mechanical ventilation, and a combination of
              sedation, analgesia, neuromuscular blocking agents and fiberoptic
              bronchoscopy were used. Surgical tracheostomy was mainly
              performed in ICU by ENT specialists, and was generally chosen
              when for patients at increased risk for difficult PDT insertion.
              Bleeding controlled by compression and stoma
              infection/inflammation were the most common intra-procedural and
              late complications, respectively. Informed consent for PDT was
              obtained in only 60 \% of cases. Conclusions This first
              international picture of current practices in regard to
              tracheostomy insertion demonstrates considerable geographic
              variation in practice, suggesting a need for greater
              standardization of approaches to tracheostomy insertion.

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The present study was designed to investigate
              orthorexia nervosa, or the phenomenon of being preoccupied with
              consuming healthy food. Specific aims were to explore
              relationships between orthorexia features and attitudes towards
              body image, fitness and health in normal weight female and male
              university students with high levels of healthy food
              preoccupation, i.e. orthorexia nervosa. METHODS: Participants
              were 327 female (N = 283) and male (N = 44) students aged 18 to
              25 years. All participants completed the Polish adaptation of the
              15-item questionnaire assessing orthorexia eating behaviours (the
              ORTHO-15) and the Multidimensional Body-Self Relations
              Questionnaire (the MBSRQ). Relationships between scores on the
              ORTHO-15 and MBSRQ were explored in the 213 students who had high
              levels of preoccupation with a healthy food intake (68.55\% women
              and 43.18\% men, respectively). RESULTS: There were no
              statistically significant differences in the levels of orthorexia
              behaviours between females and males. In female students with
              orthorexia nervosa, preoccupation with consuming healthy food was
              significantly correlated with the MBSRQ subscale scores for
              overweight preoccupation, appearance orientation, fitness
              orientation, health orientation, body areas satisfaction and
              appearance evaluation. Conversely, in male students with
              orthorexia nervosa there were no correlations between orthorexic
              behaviours and the MBSRQ subscales. In female students with
              orthorexia nervosa multivariable linear regression analysis found
              high body areas (parts) satisfaction, low fitness orientation,
              low overweight preoccupation and low appearance orientation were
              independent predictors of greater fixation on eating healthy
              food. In male students, we found that aspects of body image were
              not associated with preoccupation with healthy eating.
              CONCLUSION: A strong preoccupation with healthy and proper food
              was not associated with an unhealthy body-self relationship among

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Appearance comparison has consistently been shown to
              engender body image dissatisfaction. To date, most studies have
              demonstrated this relationship between appearance comparison and
              body image dissatisfaction in the context of conventional media
              images depicting the thin-ideal. Social comparison theory posits
              that people are more likely to compare themselves to similar
              others. Since social media forums such as Facebook involve one's
              peers, the current study aimed to determine whether the
              relationship between appearance comparison and body image
              dissatisfaction would be stronger for those exposed to social
              media images, compared to conventional media images. METHODS: A
              sample of 193 female first year university students were randomly
              allocated to view a series of either Facebook or conventional
              media thin-ideal images. Participants completed questionnaires
              assessing pre- and post- image exposure measures of thin-ideal
              internalisation, appearance comparison, self-esteem, Facebook use
              and eating disorder risk. RESULTS: Type of exposure was not found
              to moderate the relationship between appearance comparison and
              changes in body image dissatisfaction. When analysed according to
              exposure type, appearance comparison only significantly predicted
              body image dissatisfaction change for those exposed to Facebook,
              but not conventional media. Facebook use was found to predict
              higher baseline body image dissatisfaction and was associated
              with higher eating disorder risk. CONCLUSIONS: The findings
              suggest the importance of extending the body image
              dissatisfaction literature by taking into account emerging social
              media formats. It is recommended that interventions for body
              image dissatisfaction and eating disorders consider appearance
              comparison processes elicited by thin-ideal content on social

              anorexia has been well established, little is known about the
              social consequences of ``clean dieting'' and orthorexia nervosa.
              In two studies, we examined the social stigma of clean dieting
              and orthorexia. METHOD: In Study 1, participants read a vignette
              describing a woman following a ``clean'' diet, a woman with
              anorexia, or a control target (minimal information about the
              individual). In Study 2, participants read a vignette describing
              a woman with orthorexia, a woman displaying identical orthorexic
              behaviors but without the orthorexia label, a woman with
              anorexia, or a control target. Participants then rated the target
              individual on a range of measures assessing stereotypes,
              emotions, and behavioral intentions toward the target. RESULTS:
              Study 1 found that the clean-dieting target was evaluated more
              negatively than the control target on some dimensions, but less
              negatively than the target with anorexia nervosa. Study 2 found
              that evaluations of the targets with orthorexia nervosa were more
              negative than evaluations of a control target, but did not differ
              from evaluations of the target with anorexia nervosa. Perceptions
              of the target's control over her behavior were associated with
              more positive evaluations (Studies 1 and 2), whereas perceptions
              of blame and responsibility for the condition were associated
              with more negative evaluations (Study 2). CONCLUSIONS: Overall,
              these findings highlight the potential negative social
              consequences of clean dieting and orthorexia nervosa, and point
              to perceptions of control and blame as potential mechanisms
              underlying the stigma of these conditions.",

              reflects changes in evidence since the previous guideline update.
              Fourteen randomized controlled trials provide the evidence base;
              earlier phase trials also informed recommendation development.
              Recommendations New or revised recommendations include the
              following. Regarding first-line treatment for patients with
              non-squamous cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma (without
              positive markers, eg, EGFR/ALK /ROS1), if the patient has high
              programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, pembrolizumab
              should be used alone; if the patient has low PD-L1 expression,
              clinicians should offer standard chemotherapy. All other clinical
              scenarios follow 2015 recommendations. Regarding second-line
              treatment in patients who received first-line chemotherapy,
              without prior immune checkpoint therapy, if NSCLC tumor is
              positive for PD-L1 expression, clinicians should use single-agent
              nivolumab, pembrolizumab, or atezolizumab; if tumor has negative
              or unknown PD-L1 expression, clinicians should use nivolumab or
              atezolizumab. All immune checkpoint therapy is recommended alone
              plus in the absence of contraindications. For patients who
              received a prior first-line immune checkpoint inhibitor,
              clinicians should offer standard chemotherapy. For patients who
              cannot receive immune checkpoint inhibitor after chemotherapy,
              docetaxel is recommended; in patients with nonsquamous NSCLC,
              pemetrexed is recommended. In patients with a sensitizing EGFR
              mutation, disease progression after first-line epidermal growth
              factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, and T790M
              mutation, osimertinib is recommended; if NSCLC lacks the T790M
              mutation, then chemotherapy is recommended. Patients with ROS1
              gene rearrangement without prior crizotinib may be offered
              crizotinib, or if they previously received crizotinib, they may
              be offered chemotherapy.",

  abstract = "Background Rapid sequence induction and intubation (RSII) is a
              technique commonly used to resist regurgitation of gastric
              contents and protect the airway. A modification of this technique
              is implemented in certain clinical circumstances. However, there
              is currently no standard definition for a ``modified RSII.''
              Therefore, we surveyed clinicians at academic centers across the
              United States to establish a working definition of a ``modified
              RSII'' as well as the clinical scenarios in which it is being
              used. Methods A survey was created that queried the use and
              definition of modified RSII, and validated with test respondents.
              We then mailed the survey to all 131 anesthesia residency
              training programs across the United States. Logistic regression
              models were created to estimate the percentage of affirmative
              responses among respondents that performed modified RSII
              procedures and answered survey items in a consistent manner.
              Similar quantities were calculated by physician status (resident
              and attending). Results Four hundred ninety surveys were received
              from 58 institutions (44\% institution response rate), 93\% of
              respondents reported using a modified RSII, and of those 85\%
              consistently completed the survey instrument. A majority of
              respondents (71\%, CI: 63--77\%) reported administering oxygen
              before anesthesia induction, applying cricoid pressure, and
              attempting to ventilate the lungs via a facemask before securing
              the airway. Respondents noted that they would use a modified RSII
              procedure if the patient were either moderately or morbidly obese
              (each ~59\%, 53--64\%), had a history but no current symptoms of
              gastroesophageal reflux disease (52\%, 46--57\%), had a hiatal
              hernia (42\%, 36--48\%) or were a trauma patient who had been NPO
              for at least 8 hours (39\%, 33--45\%). Similar RSII results were
              obtained when repeating the analysis on the subset that did not
              enforce the consistency requirements. Conclusions Based on our
              survey we have established three defining features of a modified
              RSII: (1) oxygen administration before induction; (2) the use of
              cricoid pressure; and (3) an attempt to ventilate the patient's
              lungs before securing the airway. Although this definition seems
              intuitively obvious, no previous work has tested whether it is
              commonly accepted.",

              Intubation System was developed, consisting of a remote control
              center (joystick and intubation cockpit) linked to a standard
              videolaryngoscope via a robotic arm. Ninety intubations were
              performed by the Kepler Intubation System on an airway trainer
              mannequin by a single operator. The first group of 30 intubations
              was performed with the operator in direct view of the mannequin
              (direct view group). The second group of 30 intubations was
              performed with the operator unable to see the mannequin (indirect
              view group). Thirty semiautomated intubations were also performed
              during which the robotic system replayed a trace of a previously
              recorded intubation maneuver (semiautomated group). First-attempt
              success rates and intubation times for each trial were recorded.
              Trends were analyzed using linear regression. Data are presented
              as mean (SD). All intubations were successful at first attempt.
              The mean intubation times were 46 (18) seconds, 51 (19) seconds,
              and 41 (1) seconds for the direct view, indirect view, and
              semiautomated group, respectively. Both the direct and indirect
              view groups had a negative slope, denoting that each successive
              trial required less time. The semiautomated group had a slope of
              0 and a low SD of 1 second, illustrating the high reproducibility
              of automated intubations. We concluded that a robotic intubation
              system has been developed that can allow remote intubations

              standard of modern anesthesia. We developed a robotic system,
              Magellan, to perform nerve blocks using a remote control center.
              METHODS: Thirteen patients were enrolled in this pilot study. The
              Magellan system consists of 3 main components: a joystick, a
              robotic arm, and a software control system. The joystick allows
              simulation of wrist or arm movements of the proceduralist. After
              localization of the sciatic nerve, 35 mL of bupivacaine 0.25\%
              was injected. The success rate of sciatic nerve blocks and block

              start of the ultrasound search for the nerve to the end of the
              injection of the drug; robotic time=interval of time from the
              identification of the nerve to the end of the injection of the
              drug) were determined. Data are presented as median (25th, 75th;
              minimal, maximal) and categorical data. RESULTS: Eight men and 5
              women aged 34 years were included in this study. Nerve blocks
              were successful in all patients. A successful attempt was defined
              as the introduction of the needle into the nerve sheath; motor or
              sensory block was not used to determine the success rate. The
              nerve performance time was 189 seconds (150, 233; 90, 305),

              have changed over the last several years. We performed a survey
              to assess the current practice of tracheostomy in German
              intensive care units (ICUs). METHODS: A postal questionnaire was
              sent to the head physicians of 513 German ICUs, excluding
              pediatric ICUs. RESULTS: We obtained responses from 455 of the
              513 ICUs (89\%). In 90\% of the ICUs, tracheostomies were
              performed during the first 14 d of mechanical ventilation.
              Eighty-six percent of the ICUs routinely performed percutaneous
              dilatational tracheostomy; the modified Ciaglia technique was the
              most popular percutaneous technique (69\%). The majority (98\%)
              of the percutaneous procedures were performed under bronchoscopic
              control. Surgical tracheostomy is usually performed in the
              operating room (72\%) by a surgeon (61\%), whereas percutaneous
              dilatational tracheostomies are usually performed at the
              patient's bedside in the ICU (98\%) by an intensivist (93\%).
              Tracheostomized patients were followed up routinely in 26\% of
              the ICUs, and in 45\% of the ICUs there were guidelines regarding
              the indication, the timing and the technique of tracheostomy.
              CONCLUSION: Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy is the
              procedure of choice for tracheostomy in critically ill patients
              in Germany. The modified Ciaglia technique is the preferred
              percutaneous technique, and nearly all physicians routinely use
              bronchoscopic guidance. Most tracheostomies are done during the
              second week of mechanical ventilation.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: This prospective study tested the diathesis-stress
              and causal mediation components of Beck's (1967, 1983) cognitive
              theory of depression. DESIGN: In order to allow for a stringent
              test of the aetiological component of Beck's theory, we used a
              short-term longitudinal design in which participants'
              dysfunctional attitudes were assessed prior to the occurrence of
              a negative event. METHODS: In all, 136 high school seniors
              applying to the University of Pennsylvania completed measures of
              depressed mood and dysfunctional attitudes 1-8 weeks before
              receiving their admissions decision (Time 1). The assessment of
              dysfunctional attitudes was preceded by a priming task designed
              to activate latent depressogenic schemata. Participants also
              completed measures of depressed mood, negative views of the self,
              and negative views of the future shortly after they received
              their admissions decision (Time 2) and four days later (Time 3).
              RESULTS: Consistent with the diathesis-stress component of Beck's
              theory, dysfunctional attitudes predicted increases in depressed
              mood immediately following a negative admissions outcome (Time
              2). In addition, consistent with the causal mediation component
              of the theory, in negative outcome students, the relationship
              between dysfunctional attitudes and increases in depressed mood
              was mediated by negative views of the future. Contrary to
              predictions, however, this relationship was not mediated by
              negative views of the self. In addition, contrary to predictions,
              dysfunctional attitudes did not predict enduring depressed mood
              after a negative outcome (Time 3). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with
              dysfunctional attitudes are likely to show increases in depressed
              mood following the occurrence of negative events. The
              relationship between dysfunctional attitudes and increases in
              depressed mood following the occurrence of negative events is
              mediated by negative views of the future.",

              keep them have a negative impact on the workflow of a clinic in
              many ways. This study was conducted to identify the reasons
              patients in an urban family practice setting give for not keeping
              scheduled appointments. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were
              conducted with 34 adult patients coming to the clinic for
              outpatient care. Interviews were audiotaped and transcribed
              verbatim. A multidisciplinary team used an
              immersion-crystallization organizing style to analyze the content
              of the qualitative interviews individually and in team meetings.
              RESULTS: Participants identified 3 types of issues related to
              missing appointments without notifying the clinic staff:
              emotions, perceived disrespect, and not understanding the
              scheduling system. Although they discussed logistical issues of
              appointment keeping, participants did not identify these issues
              as key reasons for nonattendance. Appointment making among these
              participants was driven by immediate symptoms and a desire for
              self-care. At the same time, many of these participants
              experienced anticipatory fear and anxiety about both procedures
              and bad news. Participants did not feel obligated to keep a
              scheduled appointment in part because they felt disrespected by
              the health care system. The effect of this feeling was compounded
              by participants' lack of understanding of the scheduling system.
              CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that reducing
              no-show rates among patients who sometimes attend might be
              addressed by reviewing waiting times and participants'

              indicate that computed tomography (CT) lung cancer screening for
              current and former smokers with three annual screens can be
              cost-effective in a trial setting. However, the
              cost-effectiveness in a population-based setting with >3
              screening rounds is uncertain. Therefore, the objective of this
              study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of lung cancer
              screening in a population-based setting in Ontario, Canada, and
              evaluate the effects of screening eligibility criteria. METHODS
              AND FINDINGS: This study used microsimulation modeling informed
              by various data sources, including the Ontario Health Insurance
              Plan (OHIP), Ontario Cancer Registry, smoking behavior surveys,
              and the NLST. Persons, born between 1940 and 1969, were examined
              from a third-party health care payer perspective across a
              lifetime horizon. Starting in 2015, 576 CT screening scenarios
              were examined, varying by age to start and end screening, smoking
              eligibility criteria, and screening interval. Among the examined
              outcome measures were lung cancer deaths averted, life-years
              gained, percentage ever screened, costs (in 2015 Canadian
              dollars), and overdiagnosis. The results of the base-case
              analysis indicated that annual screening was more cost-effective
              than biennial screening. Scenarios with eligibility criteria that
              required as few as 20 pack-years were dominated by scenarios that
              required higher numbers of accumulated pack-years. In general,
              scenarios that applied stringent smoking eligibility criteria
              (i.e., requiring higher levels of accumulated smoking exposure)
              were more cost-effective than scenarios with less stringent
              smoking eligibility criteria, with modest differences in
              life-years gained. Annual screening between ages 55-75 for
              persons who smoked $\geq$40 pack-years and who currently smoke or
              quit $\leq$10 y ago yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness
              ratio of $41,136 Canadian dollars ($33,825 in May 1, 2015, United
              States dollars) per life-year gained (compared to annual
              screening between ages 60-75 for persons who smoked $\geq$40
              pack-years and who currently smoke or quit $\leq$10 y ago), which
              was considered optimal at a cost-effectiveness threshold of
              $50,000 Canadian dollars ($41,114 May 1, 2015, US dollars). If
              50\% lower or higher attributable costs were assumed, the
              incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of this scenario was
              estimated to be $38,240 ($31,444 May 1, 2015, US dollars) or
              $48,525 ($39,901 May 1, 2015, US dollars), respectively. If 50\%
              lower or higher costs for CT examinations were assumed, the
              incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of this scenario was
              estimated to be $28,630 ($23,542 May 1, 2015, US dollars) or
              $73,507 ($60,443 May 1, 2015, US dollars), respectively. This
              scenario would screen 9.56\% (499,261 individuals) of the total
              population (ever- and never-smokers) at least once, which would
              require 4,788,523 CT examinations, and reduce lung cancer
              mortality in the total population by 9.05\% (preventing 13,108
              lung cancer deaths), while 12.53\% of screen-detected cancers
              would be overdiagnosed (4,282 overdiagnosed cases). Sensitivity
              analyses indicated that the overall results were most sensitive
              to variations in CT examination costs. Quality of life was not
              incorporated in the analyses, and assumptions for follow-up
              procedures were based on data from the NLST, which may not be
              generalizable to a population-based setting. CONCLUSIONS: Lung
              cancer screening with stringent smoking eligibility criteria can

              aspects of the environment is now included in the DSM-5
              diagnostic criteria. However, there are children with sensory
              processing differences who do not meet an ASD diagnosis but do
              show atypical sensory behaviors to the same or greater degree as
              ASD children. We previously demonstrated that children with
              Sensory Processing Disorders (SPD) have impaired white matter
              microstructure, and that this white matter microstructural
              pathology correlates with atypical sensory behavior. In this
              study, we use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) fiber tractography
              to evaluate the structural connectivity of specific white matter
              tracts in boys with ASD (n = 15) and boys with SPD (n = 16),
              relative to typically developing children (n = 23). We define
              white matter tracts using probabilistic streamline tractography

              fractional anisotropy. Both the SPD and ASD cohorts demonstrate

              the relationship between white matter connectivity and

              sites plays an important role in the fine tuning of gene
              expression. New technologies for the execution of 3'-end enriched
              RNA-seq allow genome-wide detection of the genes that exhibit
              significant APA site switching between different samples. Here,
              we show that the independence test gives better results than the
              linear trend test in detecting APA site-switching events. Further
              examination suggests that the discrepancy between these two
              statistical methods arises from complex APA site-switching events
              that cannot be represented by a simple change of average 3'-UTR
              length. In theory, the linear trend test is only effective in
              detecting these simple changes. We classify the switching events
              into four switching patterns: two simple patterns (3'-UTR
              shortening and lengthening) and two complex patterns. By
              comparing the results of the two statistical methods, we show

              linear trend test in practice. First, the independence test
              should be used to detect APA site switching; second, the linear
              trend test should be invoked to identify simple switching events;

              obsession and preoccupation with healthy foods and a restrictive
              and avoidant eating behavior is described as orthorexia nervosa

              tools for large-scale epidemiologic assessment are available in

              psychometric properties of a translated German version of the
              ORTO-15 questionnaire. The German version of the ORTO-15, a
              eating behavior and dieting habits questionnaire were completed
              by 1029 German-speaking participants (74.6\% female) aged between
              19 and 70 years (M = 31.21 $\pm$ 10.43 years). Our results showed
              that after confirmatory factor analysis, the best fitting model
              of the original version is a single-factor structure (9-item
              shortened version: ORTO-9-GE). The final model showed only
              moderate internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = .67), even
              after omitting 40\% of the original question. A total of 69.1\%
              participants showed orthorectic tendencies. Orthorectic
              tendencies are associated with special eating behavior features
              (dieting frequency, vegetarian and vegan diet). Education level
              did not influence ON tendency and nutritional students did not
              show higher ON tendency compared to students from other
              disciplines. This study is the first attempt to translate and to
              evaluate the psychometric properties of a German version of the
              ORTO-15 questionnaire. The ORTO-9-GE questionnaire, however, is
              only a mediocre tool for assessing orthorectic tendencies in
              individuals and shows moderate reliability and internal
              consistency. Our research suggests, that future studies are
              needed to provide more reliable and valid assessment tools to

              computer model for differentiation between malignant and benign
              pulmonary nodules detected on baseline screening computed
              tomography (CT) scans. METHODS: A case-cohort study design was
              chosen. The study group consisted of 300 chest CT scans from the
              Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial (DLCST). It included all scans
              with proven malignancies (n = 62) and two subsets of randomly
              selected baseline scans with benign nodules of all sizes (n =
              120) and matched in size to the cancers, respectively (n = 118).
              Eleven observers and the computer model (PanCan) assigned a
              malignancy probability score to each nodule. Performances were
              expressed by area under the ROC curve (AUC). Performance
              differences were tested using the Dorfman, Berbaum and Metz
              method. Seven observers assessed morphological nodule
              characteristics using a predefined list. Differences in
              morphological features between malignant and size-matched benign
              nodules were analyzed using chi-square analysis with Bonferroni
              correction. A significant difference was defined at p < 0.004.
              RESULTS: Performances of the model and observers were equivalent
              (AUC 0.932 versus 0.910, p = 0.184) for risk-assessment of
              malignant and benign nodules of all sizes. However, human readers
              performed superior to the computer model for differentiating
              malignant nodules from size-matched benign nodules (AUC 0.819
              versus 0.706, p < 0.001). Large variations between observers were
              seen for ROC areas and ranges of risk scores. Morphological
              findings indicative of malignancy referred to border
              characteristics (spiculation, p < 0.001) and perinodular
              architectural deformation (distortion of surrounding lung
              parenchyma architecture, p < 0.001; pleural retraction, p =
              0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Computer model and human observers perform
              equivalent for differentiating malignant from randomly selected
              benign nodules, confirming the high potential of computer models
              for nodule risk estimation in population based screening studies.
              However, computer models highly rely on size as discriminator.
              Incorporation of other morphological criteria used by human
              observers to superiorly discriminate size-matched malignant from
              benign nodules, will further improve computer performance.",

              performance and specific yield when adjusted for location of
              lesions, target size, and diagnosis. We present a
              multi-institutional prospective-outcomes database to assess
              diagnostic yields of advanced bronchoscopic procedures, as well
              as related morbidity and mortality. METHODS: Data were extracted
              and reviewed from an ongoing, paper-based, prospective,
              multi-institutional outcomes database for advanced diagnostic
              bronchoscopic procedures. All consecutive eligible patients are
              entered into this database, and information on demographics,
              procedure, and lesion characteristics as well as complications
              were documented. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed.
              RESULTS: A total of 310 diagnostic procedures were performed over
              a 1-year period in four institutions by 15 different clinicians.
              The majority of the patients were white (66\%), male (56\%),
              former smokers (55\%), with a mean age of 61 +/- 14 years. The
              average procedure time was 36 min, and the most common procedure
              was transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) (n = 198). Nodal
              tissue was obtained in 82.3\% from TBNA sampling with a mean of
              three passes using endobronchial ultrasound guidance with a
              22-gauge needle and mostly without on-site cytology. The overall
              diagnostic yield for all procedures was 75\%. There were few
              complications, and none required a change in disposition.
              CONCLUSIONS: Prospective and ongoing data analysis for
              bronchoscopic procedures is feasible and valuable.
              Lesion-adjusted diagnostic yields can be documented and
              potentially used for comparative assessment of different
              technologies and operators, as well as benchmarking and quality

              Registry, Evaluation, and Education (AQuIRE) multicenter database
              and recorded clinical, procedural, and provider information. All
              clinical decisions, including type of TBNA used (conventional vs
              endobronchial ultrasound-guided), were made by the attending
              bronchoscopist. The primary outcome was obtaining a specific
              diagnosis. RESULTS: We enrolled 891 patients at six hospitals.
              Most procedures (95\%) were performed with ultrasound guidance. A
              specific diagnosis was made in 447 cases. Unadjusted diagnostic
              yields were 37\% to 54\% for different hospitals, with
              significant between-hospital heterogeneity (P = .0001).

              1.39-7.01; P = .018). Biopsy was performed on more and smaller
              nodes at high-volume hospitals (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: To our
              knowledge, this is the first bronchoscopy study of risk-adjusted
              diagnostic yields on a hospital-level basis. High-volume
              hospitals were associated with high diagnostic yields. This study

              Trials. When tissue diagnosis is desired, transthoracic needle
              aspiration (TTNA) is recommended. Several guided-bronchoscopy
              technologies have been developed to improve the yield of
              transbronchial biopsy for PN diagnosis: electromagnetic
              navigation bronchoscopy (ENB), virtual bronchoscopy (VB), radial
              endobronchial ultrasound (R-EBUS), ultrathin bronchoscope, and
              guide sheath. We undertook this meta-analysis to determine the
              overall diagnostic yield of guided bronchoscopy using one or a
              combination of the modalities described here. METHODS: We
              performed a MEDLINE search using ``bronchoscopy'' and ``solitary
              pulmonary nodule.'' Studies evaluating the diagnostic yield of
              ENB, VB, R-EBUS, ultrathin bronchoscope, and/or guide sheath for
              peripheral nodules were included. The overall diagnostic yield
              and yield based on size were extracted. Adverse events, if
              reported, were recorded. Meta-analysis techniques incorporating
              inverse variance weighting and a random-effects meta-analysis
              approach were used. RESULTS: A total of 3,052 lesions from 39
              studies were included. The pooled diagnostic yield was 70\%,
              which is higher than the yield for traditional transbronchial
              biopsy. The yield increased as the lesion size increased. The
              pneumothorax rate was 1.5\%, which is significantly smaller than
              that reported for TTNA. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis shows that
              the diagnostic yield of guided bronchoscopic techniques is better
              than that of traditional transbronchial biopsy. Although the
              yield remains lower than that of TTNA, the procedural risk is
              lower. Guided bronchoscopy may be an alternative or be
              complementary to TTNA for tissue sampling of PN, but further
              study is needed to determine its role in the evaluation of
              peripheral pulmonary lesions.",

              multidisciplinary teams on outcome. METHODS: The applicable
              current medical literature was identified by a computerized
              search and evaluated using standardized methods. Recommendations
              were framed using the approach described by the Guidelines
              Oversight Committee of the American College of Chest Physicians.
              Data sources included MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database of
              Systematic Reviews. RESULTS: Initial evaluation should include a
              thorough history and physical examination; CT imaging; pulmonary
              function tests; and hemoglobin, electrolyte, liver function, and
              calcium levels. Additional testing for distant metastases and
              paraneoplastic syndromes should be determined on the basis of
              these results. Paraneoplastic syndromes may have an adverse
              impact on cancer treatment, so they should be controlled rapidly
              with the goal of proceeding with definitive cancer treatment in a
              timely manner. Although the relationship between timeliness of
              care and survival is difficult to quantify, efforts to deliver
              timely care are reasonable and should be balanced with the need
              to attend to other dimensions of health-care quality (eg, safety,
              effectiveness, efficiency, equality, consistency with patient
              values and preferences). Quality care will require multiple
              disciplines. Although it is difficult to assess the impact, we

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is usually suspected in individuals who
              have an abnormal chest radiograph or have symptoms caused by
              either local or systemic effects of the tumor. The method of
              diagnosis of lung cancer depends on the type of lung cancer
              (small cell lung cancer or non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC]),
              the size and location of the primary tumor, the presence of
              metastasis, and the overall clinical status of the patient. The
              objective of this study was to determine the test performance
              characteristics of various modalities for the diagnosis of
              suspected lung cancer. METHODS: To update previous
              recommendations on techniques available for the initial diagnosis
              of lung cancer, a systematic search of the MEDLINE, Healthstar,
              and Cochrane Library databases covering material to July 2011 and
              print bibliographies was performed to identify studies comparing
              the results of sputum cytology, conventional bronchoscopy,
              flexible bronchoscopy (FB), electromagnetic navigation (EMN)
              bronchoscopy, radial endobronchial ultrasound (R-EBUS)-guided
              lung biopsy, transthoracic needle aspiration (TTNA) or biopsy,
              pleural fluid cytology, and pleural biopsy with histologic
              reference standard diagnoses among at least 50 patients with
              suspected lung cancer. Recommendations were developed by the
              writing committee, graded by a standardized method (see the
              article ``Methodology for Development of Guidelines for Lung
              Cancer'' in this guideline), and reviewed by all members of the
              Lung Cancer Guideline Panel prior to approval by the Thoracic
              Oncology NetWork, the Guidelines Oversight Committee, and the
              Board of Regents of the American College of Chest Physicians.
              RESULTS: Sputum cytology is an acceptable method of establishing
              the diagnosis of lung cancer, with a pooled sensitivity rate of
              66\% and a specificity rate of 99\%. However, the sensitivity of
              sputum cytology varies according to the location of the lung
              cancer. For central, endobronchial lesions, the overall
              sensitivity of FB for diagnosing lung cancer is 88\%. The
              diagnostic yield of bronchoscopy decreases for peripheral
              lesions. Peripheral lesions 2 cm in diameter showed a sensitivity
              of 34\% and 63\%, respectively. R-EBUS and EMN are emerging
              technologies for the diagnosis of peripheral lung cancer, with
              diagnostic yields of 73\% and 71\%, respectively. The pooled
              sensitivity of TTNA for the diagnosis of lung cancer was 90\%. A
              trend toward lower sensitivity was noted for lesions < 2 cm in
              diameter. TTNA is associated with a higher rate of pneumothorax
              compared with bronchoscopic procedures. In a patient with a
              malignant pleural effusion, pleural fluid cytology is reported to
              have a mean sensitivity of about 72\%. A definitive diagnosis of
              metastatic disease to the pleural space can be estalished with a
              pleural biopsy. The diagnostic yield for closed pleural biopsy
              ranges from 38\% to 47\% and from 75\% to 88\% for image-guided
              closed biopsy. Thoracoscopic biopsy of the pleura carries the
              highest diagnostic yield, 95\% to 97\%. The accuracy in
              differentiating between small cell and non-small cell cytology
              for the various diagnostic modalities was 98\%, with individual
              studies ranging from 94\% to 100\%. The average false-positive
              and false-negative rates were 9\% and 2\%, respectively. Although
              the distinction between small cell and NSCLC by cytology appears
              to be accurate, NSCLCs are clinically, pathologically, and
              molecularly heterogeneous tumors. In the past decade, clinical
              trials have shown us that NSCLCs respond to different therapeutic
              agents based on histologic phenotypes and molecular
              characteristics. The physician performing diagnostic procedures
              on a patient suspected of having lung cancer must ensure that
              adequate tissue is acquired to perform accurate histologic and
              molecular characterization of NSCLCs. CONCLUSIONS: The
              sensitivity of bronchoscopy is high for endobronchial disease and
              poor for peripheral lesions < 2 cm in diameter. The sensitivity
              of TTNA is excellent for malignant disease, but TTNA has a higher
              rate of pneumothorax than do bronchoscopic modalities. R-EBUS and
              EMN bronchoscopy show potential for increasing the diagnostic
              yield of FB for peripheral lung cancers. Thoracoscopic biopsy of
              the pleura has the highest diagnostic yield for diagnosis of
              metastatic pleural effusion in a patient with lung cancer.
              Adequate tissue acquisition for histologic and molecular
              characterization of NSCLCs is paramount.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Correctly staging lung cancer is important because
              the treatment options and prognosis differ significantly by
              stage. Several noninvasive imaging studies and invasive tests are
              available. Understanding the accuracy, advantages, and
              disadvantages of the available methods for staging non-small cell
              lung cancer is critical to decision-making. METHODS: Test
              accuracies for the available staging studies were updated from
              the second iteration of the American College of Chest Physicians
              Lung Cancer Guidelines. Systematic searches of the MEDLINE
              database were performed up to June 2012 with the inclusion of
              selected meta-analyses, practice guidelines, and reviews. Study
              designs and results are summarized in evidence tables. RESULTS:
              The sensitivity and specificity of CT scanning for identifying
              mediastinal lymph node metastasis were approximately 55\% and
              81\%, respectively, confirming that CT scanning has limited
              ability either to rule in or exclude mediastinal metastasis. For
              PET scanning, estimates of sensitivity and specificity for
              identifying mediastinal metastasis were approximately 77\% and
              86\%, respectively. These findings demonstrate that PET scanning
              is more accurate than CT scanning, but tissue biopsy is still
              required to confirm PET scan findings. The needle techniques
              endobronchial ultrasound-needle aspiration, endoscopic
              ultrasound-needle aspiration, and combined endobronchial
              ultrasound/endoscopic ultrasound-needle aspiration have
              sensitivities of approximately 89\%, 89\%, and 91\%,
              respectively. In direct comparison with surgical staging, needle
              techniques have emerged as the best first diagnostic tools to
              obtain tissue. Based on randomized controlled trials, PET or
              PET-CT scanning is recommended for staging and to detect
              unsuspected metastatic disease and avoid noncurative resections.
              CONCLUSIONS: Since the last iteration of the staging guidelines,
              PET scanning has assumed a more prominent role both in its use
              prior to surgery and when evaluating for metastatic disease.
              Minimally invasive needle techniques to stage the mediastinum
              have become increasingly accepted and are the tests of first
              choice to confirm mediastinal disease in accessible lymph node
              stations. If negative, these needle techniques should be followed
              by surgical biopsy. All abnormal scans should be confirmed by
              tissue biopsy (by whatever method is available) to ensure
              accurate staging. Evidence suggests that more complete staging
              improves patient outcomes.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: In the airline industry, training is costly and
              operator error must be avoided. Therefore, virtual reality (VR)
              is routinely used to learn manual and technical skills through
              simulation before pilots assume flight responsibilities. In the
              field of medicine, manual and technical skills must also be
              acquired to competently perform invasive procedures such as
              flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FFB). Until recently, training
              in FFB and other endoscopic procedures has occurred on the job in
              real patients. We hypothesized that novice trainees using a VR
              skill center could rapidly acquire basic skills, and that results
              would compare favorably with those of senior trainees trained in
              the conventional manner. METHODS: We prospectively studied five
              novice bronchoscopists entering a pulmonary and critical care
              medicine training program. They were taught to perform inspection
              flexible bronchoscopy using a VR bronchoscopy skill center;
              dexterity, speed, and accuracy were tested using the skill center
              and an inanimate airway model before and after 4 h of group
              instruction and 4 h of individual unsupervised practice. Results
              were compared to those of a control group of four skilled
              physicians who had performed at least 200 bronchoscopies during 2
              years of training. Student's t tests were used to compare mean
              scores of study and control groups for the inanimate model and VR
              bronchoscopy simulator. Before-training and after-training test
              scores were compared using paired t tests. For comparisons
              between after-training novice and skilled physician scores,
              unpaired two-sample t tests were used. RESULTS: Novices
              significantly improved their dexterity and accuracy in both
              models. They missed fewer segments after training than before
              training, and had fewer contacts with the bronchial wall. There
              was no statistically significant improvement in speed or total
              time spent not visualizing airway anatomy. After training, novice
              performance equaled or surpassed that of the skilled physicians.
              Novices performed more thorough examinations and missed
              significantly fewer segments in both the inanimate and virtual
              simulation models. CONCLUSION: A short, focused course of
              instruction and unsupervised practice using a virtual
              bronchoscopy simulator enabled novice trainees to attain a level
              of manual and technical skill at performing diagnostic
              bronchoscopic inspection similar to those of colleagues with
              several years of experience. These skills were readily
              reproducible in a conventional inanimate airway-training model,

              fiberoptic bronchoscopy in the workup of lung cancer is
              controversial. Moreover, the optimal timing of washing relative
              to biopsy and brushing is not known. In this study, the
              diagnostic yields of washings before and after biopsy and
              brushings were compared. The different diagnostic strategies were
              assessed in terms of yield and costs. DESIGN: A prospective study
              performed from 2001 to 2003 in a secondary care medical center.
              MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-one patients
              underwent flexible bronchoscopy, and the diagnostic yield of
              washings before biopsy and brushing (strategy I) and after biopsy
              and brushing (strategy II) specimens were assessed. Using the
              known probabilities and costs for various bronchoscopic
              procedures, the expected utility of a number of diagnostic
              strategies was estimated. Patients (147 men and 74 women) were
              included in the study in whom a definite cytologic or histologic
              diagnosis of pulmonary malignancy had been made. The diagnostic
              yield of strategy I was 72\% for visible tumors and 36\% for
              nonvisible tumors. For strategy II, the diagnostic yield was 74\%
              for visible tumors and in 42\% for nonvisible tumors. The
              comparison of strategies I and II for both visible and nonvisible
              tumors revealed that 176 cases were concordant (80\%); in 19
              cases (9\%) the cytologic analysis of washings in strategy I was
              positive for malignancy and negative in strategy II. In 26 cases
              (12\%) washings in strategy II were positive and negative in
              strategy I (p = 0.37). An analysis of the diagnostic yield of
              both washings in visible tumors and nonvisible tumors showed no
              significant difference. In 13 patients, a diagnosis of malignancy
              was established only by washings (6\%). Confining the laboratory
              investigations of washings or brush samples to those cases in
              which the initial findings of the biopsies are negative (the
              two-stage procedure) is more cost-effective than examining all
              biopsy, brushing, and washing specimens. In patients with visible
              tumors, brushing or washing in addition to biopsy is equally
              cost-effective; in patients with nonvisible tumors, biopsy
              combined with washing is the preferred option. CONCLUSIONS: No
              difference in the diagnostic yield could be demonstrated for
              washings before or after biopsies and brushings. Although the
              additional diagnostic yield of washing and brushing during
              bronchoscopy is relatively low, it is cost-effective to use these
              procedures in the diagnostic workup of patients who are
              clinically suspected of having a pulmonary malignancy.",

              CME performed by a single surgeon since the beginning of his
              surgical practice were retrospectively analyzed for operative
              duration and perioperative outcomes. RESULTS: The study included
              81 patients. The average duration of surgery was 220.0 (range
              206-233) minutes. The initial durations of about 250 minutes
              gradually decreased to less than 200 minutes in an inverse linear
              relationship (y = -0.58x $\times$ 248). The major complication
              rate was 3.6\% $\pm$ 4.2\% and the average nodal yield was 31.3
              $\pm$ 4.1. CumulativeSum analysis showed acceptable complication
              rates and oncological results from the beginning of surgeon's
              laparoscopic career. CONCLUSION: Developing laparoscopic skills
              can provide acceptable outcomes in advanced right hemicolectomy
              for a surgeon who primarily trained in open colorectal surgery.
              Operative duration is nearly triple that reported for
              conventional laparoscopic right hemicolectomy. The slow operative
              duration learning curve without a plateau reflects complex
              anatomy and the need for careful dissection around critical
              structures. Should one wish to adopt this strategy either based
              on some available evidence of superiority or with intention to
              participate in research, one has to change the view of right
              hemicolectomy being a rather simple case to being a complex,
              lengthy laparoscopic surgery.",

  abstract = "RATIONALE: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends
              lung cancer screening with low-dose chest computed tomographic
              scans (LDCT) for a well-defined high-risk population. Data on the
              frequency and impact of incidental findings (IFs) based on LDCT
              scans performed within a centralized lung cancer screening
              program have not been reported. OBJECTIVES: Researchers in
              previous studies have reported IFs in the setting of clinical
              trials. We present our findings in a real clinical setting where
              the decision to manage these findings may depend on factors that
              are not captured in a research trial such as disclosing IFs,
              patient preferences, severity of comorbidities, and physician
              expertise. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of
              participants in the Cleveland Clinic Lung Cancer Screening
              Program from April 1, 2015, to February 17, 2016. Lung Imaging
              Reporting and Data System categories and all reported findings
              were extracted from the structured radiology report. Downstream
              investigations that occurred as a result of the imaging findings
              were recorded. Medicare reimbursement rates were documented for
              all screening-related testing and treatment. RESULTS: A total of
              320 LDCT-screened patients' records were reviewed. The most
              commonly reported IFs were pulmonary (69.6\%), cardiovascular
              (67.5\%), and gastrointestinal (25.9\%). Fifteen percent of the
              scans had an IF that resulted in further evaluation. The majority
              of patients who underwent further testing had cardiovascular
              findings (10.3\%); less frequently, they had thyroid or adrenal
              nodules (2.1\%), hepatic lesions (0.9\%), renal masses (0.6\%),
              or pulmonary disease (0.6\%). The most frequently ordered
              investigations were echocardiography (n = 9), cardiac stress test
              (n = 9), and CT angiography (n = 6). Reimbursement for the
              screening process, evaluation, and treatment of
              screening-detected findings averaged \$817 per screened patient.
              CONCLUSIONS: Clinically significant IFs on LDCT scans for lung
              cancer screening are common, and their potential impact should be
              included in the shared decision-making process. Screening program
              staff should develop a standard approach for the evaluation of
              these findings and consider the financial impact when seeking
              infrastructure support for screening program implementation.",

              psychoanalysis by those who have shifted to relationship or
              so-called two-person psychologies in our field. The author begins
              by briefly describing a parallel to the recent history of
              psychoanalysis in the sudden rise and fall of scholastic
              philosophy in the 14th century. He then focuses on contemporary
              attacks on Freud's psychoanalysis as a science, based on the
              contention by two-person psychologists that free association by
              the patient and evenly hovering attention by the analyst are
              actually impossible. He reviews Freud's idea of psychoanalysis,
              discusses psychodynamic psychotherapy, both conceived as
              scientific treatment procedures, and describes the current
              assault on their metapsychological and epistemological
              foundations. Returning to the parallel between what happened to
              medieval scholasticism and what has happened to psychoanalysis,
              he examines why this happened, and the resulting fragmentation of
              psychoanalytic practice. The article concludes with suggestions
              for the integration of various schools of psychoanalysis,
              reminding us of Benjamin Franklin's warning: ``We must, indeed,

              cell homeostasis. While heterogeneity of gene expression levels
              has been extensively studied, less attention has been paid to
              mRNA polyadenylation isoform choice. 3' untranslated regions
              regulate mRNA fate, and their choice is tightly controlled during
              development, but how 3' isoform usage varies within genetically
              and developmentally homogeneous cell populations has not been

              BATSeq. By applying BATBayes, a statistical framework for
              analyzing single-cell isoform data, we find that while the
              developmental state of the cell globally determines isoform
              usage, single cells from the same state differ in the choice of
              isoforms. Notably this variation exceeds random selection with
              equal preference in all cells, a finding that was confirmed by
              RNA FISH data. Variability in 3' isoform choice has potential

              health care providers use or are interested in using
              complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). People around the

              that have apply the same general legal principles used in cases
              that involved conventional care while taking into account
              considerations unique to CAM. In ethics, as with conventional
              care, the issues surrounding pediatric CAM use usually involve
              questions about who the appropriate decision-makers are, on what
              ethical principles should clinical decision-making rely, and what
              obligations arise on the part of physicians and other health care

              procedure rehearsals using a pulsatile silicon aneurysm model, a
              78-year-old man underwent robot-assisted EVAR of a 5.9-cm

              72-year-old man with end-stage lung disease who received a left
              single lung transplant. On postoperative day 54, he was evaluated

              marked clinical improvement. Fourteen months later, he presented

              attempts at catheterization and balloon angioplasty of the stent

              Chronic total occlusions account for a significant portion of the
              lesions encountered by endovascular interventionalists. Unlike
              the coronary circulation, these occlusions are often long and
              associated with other features of complexity. The two primary
              issues concerning these lesions are the ability to safely achieve
              intimal angiographic success and the long-term durability of
              therapy. Traditionally, the use of percutaneous techniques was

              precise definition and radiographic anatomical landmarks
              separating central and peripheral lesion does not yet exist. The
              radiographic detection of such lesions has increased
              significantly with the adoption of lung cancer screening
              programs. These lesions are not directly visible by regular
              flexible bronchoscopes as they are usually distal to the lobar
              and segmental bronchi. Traditionally, depending on location and
              clinical stage at presentation, these lesions were typically
              sampled by computerized tomography (CT) guided needle or surgical
              biopsy although some centers also used ultrasound and fluoroscopy
              guided percutaneous needle biopsy. Due to lack of direct
              visualization, the yield for bronchoscopic guided sampling
              especially of the small <2 cm pulmonary nodules was very low.
              Therefore, sampling has been preferentially performed by
              percutaneous CT guidance, which had high yield of above 90\% but
              it comes at the cost of higher risk complications like
              pneumothorax with reported rate of 15\% to 28\%. Directly
              proceeding to surgical resection is also considered in

               men); however, more men than women ate 1-2 meals daily (18.95\%
               men versus 7.9\% women). Both place of birth and field of study
               did not differ in terms of the number of meals. Moreover, it was
               observed that the number of meals per day was correlated with
               the declared time spent on planning a diet. People who ate over
               3 meals per day more often indicates that they spent >3 h per
               day on planning their diet in comparison with people who ate
               only 1-2 meals. Only 17.6\% of the respondents declared that
               they most often ate meals in a company of someone, whereas
               45.3\% indicated that there was no rule. The remaining 37.1\% of

              nutrition that is characterized by a restrictive diet, ritualized
              patterns of eating, and rigid avoidance of foods believed to be
              unhealthy or impure. Although prompted by a desire to achieve
              optimum health, orthorexia may lead to nutritional deficiencies,
              medical complications, and poor quality of life. Despite its
              being a distinct behavioral pattern that is frequently observed
              by clinicians, orthorexia has received very little empirical
              attention and is not yet formally recognized as a psychiatric
              disorder. In this review, we synthesize existing research to
              identify what is known about the symptoms, prevalence,
              neuropsychological profile, and treatment of orthorexia. An
              examination of diagnostic boundaries reveals important points of
              symptom overlap between orthorexia and anorexia nervosa,
              obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), obsessive-compulsive
              personality disorder (OCPD), somatic symptom disorder, illness
              anxiety disorder, and psychotic spectrum disorders.
              Neuropsychological data suggest that orthorexic symptoms are
              independently associated with key facets of executive dysfunction
              for which some of these conditions already overlap. Discussion of
              cognitive weaknesses in set-shifting, external attention, and
              working memory highlights the value of continued research to
              identify intermediate, transdiagnostic endophenotypes for insight
              into the neuropathogenesis of orthorexia. An evaluation of
              current orthorexia measures indicates a need for further
              psychometric development to ensure that subsequent research has
              access to reliable and valid assessment tools. Optimized
              assessment will not only permit a clearer understanding of
              prevalence rates, psychosocial risk factors, and comorbid
              psychopathology but will also be needed to index intervention
              effectiveness. Though the field lacks data on therapeutic
              outcomes, current best practices suggest that orthorexia can
              successfully be treated with a combination of

               developing norms related to health behaviors and body image, and
               social media can influence these norms. Social media is
               saturated with content related to dieting, fitness, and health.
               Health and fitness-related social media content has received
               significant media attention for often containing objectifying
               and inaccurate health messages. Limited research has identified
               problematic features of such content, including stigmatizing
               language around weight, portraying guilt-related messages
               regarding food, and praising thinness. However, no research has
               identified who is ``liking'' or ``following'' (ie, consuming)
               such content. OBJECTIVE: This exploratory study aimed to
               identify demographics, mental health, and substance use-related
               behaviors that predicted consuming 3 types of health and
               fitness-related social media content-weight loss/fitness
               motivation pages (ie, ``fitspiration''), detox/cleanse pages,
               and diet/fitness plan pages-among young social media users.
               METHODS: Participants (N=1001; age: median 21.06, IQR
               17.64-24.64; female: 723/1001, 72.23\%) completed a
               cross-sectional 112-question online survey aimed at social media
               users aged between 15-29 years residing in Victoria, Australia.
               Logistic regression was used to determine which characteristics
               predicted consuming the 3 types of health and fitness-related
               social media content. RESULTS: A total of 378 (37.76\%)
               participants reported consuming at least 1 of the 3 types of
               health and fitness-related social media content: 308 (30.77\%)
               fitspiration pages, 145 (14.49\%) detox pages, and 235 (23.48\%)
               diet/fitness plan pages. Of the health and fitness-related
               social media content consumers, 85.7\% (324/378) identified as
               female and 44.8\% (324/723) of all female participants consumed
               at least 1 type of health and fitness-related social media
               content. Predictors of consuming at least one type of health and
               fitness-related social media content in univariable analysis
               included female gender (OR 3.5, 95\% CI 2.5-4.9, P<.001), being
               aged 15-17 years (OR 3.0, 95\% CI 2.2-4.0, P<.001), residing
               outside a major city (OR 2.0, 95\% CI 1.4-2.9, P<.001), having
               no post-high school education (OR 2.2, 95\% CI 1.7-2.9, P<.001),
               being born in Australia (OR 2.0, 95\% CI 1.2-3.2, P=.006),
               having a self-reported eating disorder (OR 2.4, 95\% CI 1.5-3.9,
               P<.001), being a victim of bullying (OR 1.7, CI 1.3-2.3,

               social media content were predominantly teenaged girls. There is
               a need to ensure that this social media content portrays
               responsible health messages and to research further the role of

              it with estimates from 2004. Methods For the 194 Member States of
              the World Health Organization, we searched PubMed for studies and
              contacted key informants for reports on surgical volumes between
              2005 and 2012. We obtained data on population and total health
              expenditure per capita for 2012 and categorized Member States as
              very-low, low, middle and high expenditure. Data on caesarean
              delivery were obtained from validated statistical reports. For
              Member States without recorded surgical data, we estimated
              volumes by multiple imputation using data on total health
              expenditure. We estimated caesarean deliveries as a proportion of
              all surgery. Findings We identified 66 Member States reporting
              surgical data. We estimated that 312.9 million operations (95\%
              confidence interval, CI: 266.2--359.5) took place in 2012, an
              increase from the 2004 estimate of 226.4 million operations. Only
              6.3\% (95\% CI: 1.7--22.9) and 23.1\% (95\% CI: 14.8--36.7) of
              operations took place in very-low- and low-expenditure Member
              States representing 36.8\% (2573 million people) and 34.2\% (2393
              million people) of the global population of 7001 million people,
              respectively. Caesarean deliveries comprised 29.6\% (5.8/19.6
              million operations; 95\% CI: 9.7--91.7) of the total surgical
              volume in very-low-expenditure Member States, but only 2.7\%
              (5.1/187.0 million operations; 95\% CI: 2.2--3.4) in
              high-expenditure Member States. Conclusion Surgical volume is
              large and growing, with caesarean delivery comprising nearly a
              third of operations in most resource-poor settings. Nonetheless,

              perform clinically indicated PCI. The first 3 cases performed by
              each interventional cardiologist were considered early-experience
              cases and subsequent procedures were regarded as
              advanced-experience cases. We compared procedure efficiency,
              patient radiation exposure, and clinical outcomes in early and
              advanced-experience cases. RESULTS: A total of 164
              robotic-enhanced PCI procedures were performed, with 60
              early-experience cases. Advanced-experience cases were associated
              with shorter procedure duration (51.3 $\pm$ 25.5 min vs. 42.2

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE Surgical robotics has demonstrated utility across the
              spectrum of surgery. Robotics in spine surgery, however, remains
              in its infancy. Here, the authors systematically review the
              evidence behind robotic applications in spinal instrumentation.
              METHODS This systematic review was conducted according to the
              Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
              Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Relevant studies (through
              October 2016) that reported the use of robotics in spinal
              instrumentation were identified from a search of the PubMed
              database. Data regarding the accuracy of screw placement, surgeon
              learning curve, radiation exposure, and reasons for robotic
              failure were extracted. RESULTS Twenty-five studies describing 2
              unique robots met inclusion criteria. Of these, 22 studies
              evaluated accuracy of spinal instrumentation. Although grading of
              pedicle screw accuracy was variable, the most commonly used
              method was the Gertzbein and Robbins system of classification. In
              the studies using the Gertzbein and Robbins system, accuracy
              (Grades A and B) ranged from 85\% to 100\%. Ten studies evaluated
              radiation exposure during the procedure. In studies that detailed
              fluoroscopy usage, overall fluoroscopy times ranged from 1.3 to
              34 seconds per screw. Nine studies examined the learning curve
              for the surgeon, and 12 studies described causes of robotic
              failure, which included registration failure, soft-tissue
              hindrance, and lateral skiving of the drill guide. CONCLUSIONS
              Robotics in spine surgery is an emerging technology that holds
              promise for future applications. Surgical accuracy in
              instrumentation implanted using robotics appears to be high.
              However, the impact of robotics on radiation exposure is not
              clear and seems to be dependent on technique and robot type.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE The quest to improve the safety and accuracy and
              decrease the invasiveness of pedicle screw placement in spine
              surgery has led to a markedly increased interest in robotic
              technology. The SpineAssist from Mazor is one of the most widely
              distributed robotic systems. The aim of this study was to compare
              the accuracy of robot-guided and conventional freehand
              fluoroscopy-guided pedicle screw placement in thoracolumbar
              surgery. METHODS This study is a retrospective series of 169
              patients (83 women [49\%]) who underwent placement of pedicle
              screw instrumentation from 2007 to 2015 in 2 reference centers.
              Pathological entities included degenerative disorders, tumors,
              and traumatic cases. In the robot-assisted cohort (98 patients,
              439 screws), pedicle screws were inserted with robotic
              assistance. In the freehand fluoroscopy-guided cohort (71
              patients, 441 screws), screws were inserted using anatomical
              landmarks and lateral fluoroscopic guidance. Patients treated
              before 2009 were included in the fluoroscopy cohort, whereas
              those treated since mid-2009 (when the robot was acquired) were
              included in the robot cohort. Since then, the decision to operate
              using robotic assistance or conventional freehand technique has
              been based on surgeon preference and logistics. The accuracy of
              screw placement was assessed based on the Gertzbein-Robbins scale
              by a neuroradiologist blinded to treatment group. The
              radiological slice with the largest visible deviation from the
              pedicle was chosen for grading. A pedicle breach of 2 mm or less
              was deemed acceptable (Grades A and B) while deviations greater
              than 2 mm (Grades C, D, and E) were classified as misplacements.
              RESULTS In the robot-assisted cohort, a perfect trajectory (Grade
              A) was observed for 366 screws (83.4\%). The remaining screws
              were Grades B (n = 44 [10\%]), C (n = 15 [3.4\%]), D (n = 8
              [1.8\%]), and E (n = 6 [1.4\%]). In the fluoroscopy-guided group,
              a completely intrapedicular course graded as A was found in 76\%
              (n = 335). The remaining screws were Grades B (n = 57 [12.9\%]),
              C (n = 29 [6.6\%]), D (n = 12 [2.7\%]), and E (n = 8 [1.8\%]).
              The proportion of non-misplaced screws (corresponding to
              Gertzbein-Robbins Grades A and B) was higher in the
              robot-assisted group (93.4\%) than the freehand fluoroscopy group
              (88.9\%) (p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS The authors' retrospective case
              review found that robot-guided pedicle screw placement is a safe,
              useful, and potentially more accurate alternative to the

              of activities that opens up the future of ergonomics. Corrective
              ergonomics relates to the past and comes with a demand and a

              ``epidemic of diagnosis.'' Over the past decade of available
              data, the overall cancer incidence rate (2004-2013) was stable in
              women and declined by approximately 2\% annually in men, while
              the cancer death rate (2005-2014) declined by about 1.5\%
              annually in both men and women. From 1991 to 2014, the overall
              cancer death rate dropped 25\%, translating to approximately
              2,143,200 fewer cancer deaths than would have been expected if
              death rates had remained at their peak. Although the cancer death
              rate was 15\% higher in blacks than in whites in 2014, increasing
              access to care as a result of the Patient Protection and
              Affordable Care Act may expedite the narrowing racial gap; from
              2010 to 2015, the proportion of blacks who were uninsured halved,
              from 21\% to 11\%, as it did for Hispanics (31\% to 16\%). Gains
              in coverage for traditionally underserved Americans will

              actual (e.g., I am thin) and desired ideal body image (e.g., I
              want to be thin). Body dissatisfaction was examined via
              self-report questionnaires and rating scales. As expected,
              differences in body dissatisfaction exerted a differential
              influence on the two IRAP scores. Specifically, the implicit
              belief that one is thin was lower in participants who exhibited a
              high degree of body dissatisfaction than in participants who
              exhibited a low degree of body dissatisfaction. In contrast, the

              clinical features between some children with High Intellectual
              Potential (HIP or ``Giftedness'' = Total IQ > 2 SD), and children
              with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) without intellectual or
              language delay, formerly diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome. Some
              of these common features are social interaction impairments,
              special interests, and in some cases high-verbal abilities. The
              aim of this article is to determine whether these similarities
              exist at more fundamental levels, other than clinical, and to
              explore the literature in order to provide empirical support for
              an overlap between ASD and HIP. Method: First, comparative
              studies between ASD and HIP children were sought. Because of a
              lack of data, the respective characteristics of ASD and HIP
              subjects were explored by a cross-sectional review of different
              areas of research. Emphasis was placed on psychometric and
              cognitive evaluations, experimental and developmental
              assessments, and neurobiological research, following a
              ``bottom-up'' procedure. Results: This review highlights the
              existence of similarities in the neurocognitive, developmental
              and neurobiological domains between these profiles, which require
              further study. In addition, the conclusions of several studies
              show that there are differences between HIP children with a
              homogeneous Intellectual Quotient profile and children with a
              heterogeneous Intellectual Quotient profile. Conclusion: HIP
              seems to cover different developmental profiles, one of which
              might share features with ASD. A new line of investigation
              providing a possible starting-point for future research is

              responsibility of lung cancer patients and the impact of this
              burden on family income. METHODS: This study uses data from a
              retrospective questionnaire survey conducted in 10 communities in
              urban China and includes 195 surviving lung cancer patients
              diagnosed over the previous five years. The calculation of direct
              economic burden included both direct medical and direct
              nonmedical costs. Indirect costs were calculated using the human
              capital approach, which measures the productivity lost for both
              patients and family caregivers. The price index was applied for
              the cost calculation. RESULTS: The average economic burden from
              lung cancer was $43,336 per patient, of which the direct cost per
              capita was $42,540 (98.16\%) and the indirect cost per capita was

              of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) resulting in more
              peripheral cancers. Conventional bronchoscopy is often not
              sufficient to obtain adequate tissue samples for diagnosis.
              Radiologically guided transthoracic biopsy is a sensitive
              alternative, but carries significant risks. These limitations
              have driven the development of complimentary bronchoscopic
              navigation techniques for peripheral tumour localisation and
              sampling. Furthermore, linear endobronchial ultrasound with
              transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is increasingly

  abstract = "Recent changes in the organisation of primary health care have
              increased the range of professionals that patients may encounter,
              leading to renewed interest in the importance of continuity of
              care. To assess whether organisational changes have had an impact
              on continuity, it is necessary to define and measure the term.
              Researchers seeking to assess continuity face many conceptual and
              practical difficulties. This article argues that it is important
              to distinguish between three distinct but related concepts:
              longitudinal continuity from a minimum number of health
              professionals, caring relationships between patients and
              professionals, and well-coordinated care between professionals.
              An evaluation of Advanced Access as a case study is used to
              illustrate how researchers need to make several value judgements
              in operationalising longitudinal continuity. These include
              whether continuity should be measured from the perspective of
              patient, doctor, or healthcare system, the types of professionals
              and consultations that should be considered, the time period to
              be assessed, the measure to be used, and also practical
              considerations about data collection. It is argued that decisions
              about these issues should be based on an underlying hypothesis
              about why continuity may be important in the particular context.
              Distinguishing between longitudinal continuity,
              patient--professional relationships, and coordinated care makes
              it possible to examine interactions between these different
              concepts, and to examine relationships with outcomes such as
              patient satisfaction and quality of care. It will also give

              discomfort, meaningful complication rates, and predictors.
              METHOD: We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed on
              8 February 2016, using a search strategy including the PICO
              model, on complications and discomfort related to bronchoscopy
              and related sampling techniques. RESULTS: The search yielded
              1,707 hits, of which 45 publications were eligible for full
              review. Rates of mortality and severe complications were low.
              Other complications, for instance, hypoxaemia, bleeding,
              pneumothorax, and fever, were usually not related to patient
              characteristics or aspects of the procedure, and complication
              rates showed considerable ranges. Measures of patient discomfort
              differed considerably, and results were difficult to compare

  abstract = "Bratman first proposed orthorexia nervosa in the late 1990s,
              defining it an obsession with eating healthy food to achieve, for
              instance, improved health. Today, in the Swedish media, excessive
              exercising plays a central role in relation to orthorexia. A few
              review articles on orthorexia have been conducted; however, these
              have not focused on aspects of food and eating, sport, exercise,
              or a societal perspective. The overall aim of this study was to
              provide an overview and synthesis of what philosophies of science
              approaches form the current academic framework of orthorexia. Key
              questions were: What aspects of food and eating are related to
              orthorexia? What role do exercise and sports play in relation to
              orthorexia? In what ways are orthorexia contextualized?
              Consequently, the concept of healthism was used to discuss and
              contextualize orthorexia. The method used was an integrative
              literature review; the material covered 19 empirical and
              theoretical articles published in peer-reviewed journals. This
              review demonstrates a multifaceted nature of orthorexia research;
              this field has been examined from four different philosophies of
              science approaches (i.e., empirical-atomistic,
              empirical-atomistic with elements of empirical-holistic,
              empirical-holistic, and rational-holistic) on individual, social,
              and societal levels. The majority of the articles followed an
              empirical-atomistic approach that focused on orthorexia as an
              individual issue, which was discussed using healthism. Our
              analysis indicates a need for (a) more empirical-holistic
              research that applies interpretive qualitative methods and uses a
              social perspective of health, e.g., healthism and (b) examining
              the role of sports and exercise in relation to orthorexia that
              takes the problematizing of ``orthorexic behaviours'' within the

              been shown to reduce mortality from lung cancer; however, the
              optimal screening duration and ``at risk'' population are not
              known. METHODS: The Cancer Risk Management Model developed by
              Statistics Canada for the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer
              includes a lung screening module based on data from the U.S.
              National Lung Screening Trial (nlst). The base-case scenario
              reproduces nlst outcomes with high fidelity. The impact in Canada
              of annual screening on the number of incident cases and
              life-years gained, with a wider range of age and smoking history
              eligibility criteria and varied participation rates, was modelled
              to show the magnitude of clinical benefit nationally and by
              province. Life-years gained, costs (discounted and undiscounted),
              and resource requirements were also estimated. RESULTS: In 2014,
              1.4 million Canadians were eligible for screening according to
              nlst criteria. Over 10 years, screening would detect 12,500 more
              lung cancers than the expected 268,300 and would gain 9200
              life-years. The computed tomography imaging requirement of
              24,000-30,000 at program initiation would rise to between 87,000
              and 113,000 by the 5th year of an annual nlst-like screening
              program. Costs would increase from approximately \$75 million to
              \$128 million at 10 years, and the cumulative cost nationally
              over 10 years would approach \$1 billion, partially offset by a
              reduction in the costs of managing advanced lung cancer.
              CONCLUSIONS: Modelling various ways in which ldct might be
              implemented provides decision-makers with estimates of the effect

              is a valuable tool used for the diagnosis of countless thoracic
              diseases. Computed tomography (CT) is the most common imaging
              modality used for guidance followed by ultrasound (US) for
              lesions abutting the pleural surface. Novel approaches using
              virtual CT guidance have recently been introduced. The objective
              of this review is to examine the current literature for TTNA
              biopsy of the lung focusing on diagnostic accuracy and safety.
              METHODS: MEDLINE was searched from inception to October 2015 for
              all case series examining image guided TTNA. Articles focusing on
              fluoroscopic guidance as well as influence of rapid on-site
              evaluation (ROSE) on yield were excluded. The diagnostic
              accuracy, defined as the number of true positives divided by the
              number of biopsies done, as well as the complication rate
              [pneumothorax (PTX), bleeding] was examined for CT guided TTNA,
              US guided TTNA as well as CT guided electromagnetic
              navigational-TTNA (E-TTNA). Of the 490 articles recovered 75 were
              included in our analysis. RESULTS: The overall pooled diagnostic
              accuracy for CT guided TTNA using 48 articles that met the
              inclusion and exclusion criteria was 92.1\% (9,567/10,383). A
              similar yield was obtained examining ten articles using US guided
              TTNA of 88.7\% (446/503). E-TTNA, being a new modality, only had
              one pilot study citing a diagnostic accuracy of 83\% (19/23).
              Pooled PTX and hemorrhage rates were 20.5\% and 2.8\%
              respectively for CT guided TTNA. The PTX rate was lower in US
              guided TTNA at a pooled rate of 4.4\%. E-TTNA showed a similar
              rate of PTX at 20\% with no incidence of bleeding in a single
              pilot study available. CONCLUSIONS: Image guided TTNA is a safe
              and accurate modality for the biopsy of lung pathology. This

  abstract = "CONTEXT: Research has suggested that the prevalence of young
              women with eating disorders (EDs) is increasing, but determining
              the exact prevalence of EDs within the female student-athlete
              (FS-A) population is difficult. Looking at certain traits may
              help us to identify their level of susceptibility to developing
              an ED. OBJECTIVE: To determine the susceptibility of FS-As to EDs
              in relation to self-concept, including self-esteem and body
              image. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Athletic training
              and health centers at National Collegiate Athletic Association
              Division I, II, and III institutions via e-mail questionnaire
              correspondence. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A total of 439
              FS-As from 17 participating institutions completed the
              questionnaires. The sample was primarily white (83.1\%) and
              underclass (61.8\%). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The questionnaire
              consisted of 4 parts: 3 subscales of the Eating Disorder
              Inventory-2, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, the Body Cathexis
              Scale, and demographic items. RESULTS: A total of 6.8\% of FS-As
              were susceptible to anorexia and 1.8\% were susceptible to
              bulimia. The majority of FS-As (61\%) reported normal self-esteem
              levels, whereas 29.4\% had high self-esteem. Overall, 64.5\% were
              satisfied and 23\% were very satisfied with their body image.
              CONCLUSIONS: These results are generally positive in that they
              suggest FS-As have high levels of self-concept and are at low
              risk to develop EDs. However, these findings do not mean that all
              concerns should be dismissed. Although more than 90\% of the
              respondents were not susceptible to an ED, there are still FS-As
              who may be. Athletic departments should evaluate their FS-As'
              levels of self-concept so that their susceptibility to EDs can be
              addressed. The emotional aspect of health care should be included
              in providing holistic care for student-athletes. Athletic
              trainers often are the primary health care providers for FS-As,

              endobronchial tubes (DLETT) and bronchial blockers (BBs) with the

              practice worldwide. Most centers possess standard adult FOBs,
              some, particularly in developing countries might not have access
              to the pediatric-sized devices. We have evaluated the role of
              preintubation airway assessment using the former, measuring the
              distance from the incisors to the carina and from carina to the
              left and right upper lobe bronchus in deciding the depth of
              insertion of the lung isolation device. Methods: The study was a
              randomized, controlled, double-blind trial consisting of 84
              patients (all >18 years) undergoing thoracic surgery over a
              12-month period. In the study group (n = 38), measurements
              obtained during FOB with the adult bronchoscope decided the depth
              of insertion of the lung isolation device. In the control group
              (n = 46), DLETTs and BBs were placed blindly followed by clinical
              confirmation by auscultation. Selection of the type and size of
              the lung isolation device was at the discretion of the
              anesthesiologist conducting the case. In all cases, pediatric FOB
              was used to confirm accurate placement of devices. Results: Of 84
              patients (DLETT used in 76 patients; BB used in 8 patients),
              preintubation airway measurements significantly improved the
              success rate of optimal placement of lung isolation device from
              25\% (11/44) to 50\% (18/36) (P = 0.04). Our incidence of failed
              device placement at initial insertion was 4.7\% (4/84). Incidence
              of malposition was 10\% (8/80) with 4 cases in each group. The

              ``the intubation'' as we call is not as simple as it looks. It is
              a very tricky and tedious maneuver that entails skills to assess
              and perform. Nevertheless, often this is left to the chores of
              inefficient hands due to a paucity of the availability of
              experts. They seldom are able to complete the task and often wind
              up calling the attention of the unit. The present review is an
              attempt to describe the need to undertake intubation, the
              procedures and techniques, the complications, including morbidity
              and mortality and airway management. This overview includes
              explicit descriptions of the difficult airway which represents
              multifaceted interface amid patient factors, clinical setting,
              and skills of the practitioner. Materials and Methods: To
              accomplish the target, peer-reviewed English language articles
              published during third millennium up to 2013 were selected from
              Pub Med, Pub Med Central, Science Direct, Up-to-date, Med Line,
              comprehensive databases, Cochrane library, and the Internet

              necessitate the practice of intubation, different techniques that
              facilitate easy conduct of procedure, the complications,

              to participate was e-mailed to all members of the ME
              thoracic-anaesthesia group. A total of 58 members participated in
              the survey from 19 institutions in the Middle East. Questions
              concerned ventilation strategies during one-lung ventilation
              (OLV), anesthesia regimen, mode of postoperative analgesia, use
              of lung isolation techniques, and use of i.v. fluids. Results:
              Volume-controlled ventilation was favored over
              pressure-controlled ventilation (62\% vs 38\% of respondents,
              P<0.05); 43\% report the routine use of positive end-expiratory
              pressure. One hundred percent of respondents report using
              double-lumen tube (DLT) as a first choice airway to establish
              OLV. Nearly a third of respondents, 31.1\%, report never using
              bronchial blocker (BB) in their thoracic anesthesia practice.
              Failure to pass a DLT and difficult airway are the most commonly
              cited indications for BB use. Regarding postoperative analgesia,
              the majority 61.8\% favor thoracic epidural analgesia over other

              are generated in the majority of cases by site-specific
              endonucleolytic cleavage, followed by the addition of a poly(A)
              tail. Through alternative polyadenylation, a gene can give rise
              to multiple mRNA isoforms that differ in the length of their 3'
              UTRs and hence in their susceptibility to post-transcriptional
              regulatory factors such as microRNAs. A series of recently
              conducted high-throughput studies of poly(A) site usage revealed
              an extensive tissue-specific control and drastic changes in the
              length of mRNA 3' UTRs upon induction of proliferation in resting
              cells. To understand the dynamics of poly(A) site choice, we

               science fiction as a source of visionary fascinating technology
               that is going to be part of our daily life. When the Czech Capek
               brothers wrote their science fiction stories and coined the term
               robot, they probably based it on the 16th century Jewish-Czech
               folklore of the Golem of Prague, who was created by the rabbi of
               Prague (the Maharal) to protect his community from the hostile
               anti-Semites. In Hebrew, the world Golem is used as a metaphor

               controlled conditions. The most significant boost to public
               recognition of the robotic concept was done by Isaac Asimov, who
               published a series of short stories about robots and contributed
               the famous three laws of robotic behavior or function. The
               robots in his stories, like the Golem, were independent machines

              significant advantages like enhanced patient safety. Access to
              bronchoscopy simulators may be limited in low resources settings.
              We developed a low-cost 3D printed bronchoscopy training model.
              METHODS: A parametric airway model was obtained from an online
              medical model repository and fabricated using a low-cost 3D
              printer. Participating physicians had no prior bronchoscopy
              experience. Participants received a 30-minute lecture on flexible
              bronchoscopy and were administered a 15-item pre-test
              questionnaire on bronchoscopy. After, participants were
              instructed to perform a series of predetermined bronchoscopy
              tasks on the 3D printed simulator on 4 consecutive occasions.
              Time to perform the tasks and the quality of the performance
              (identification of bronchial anatomy, technique, dexterity, lack
              of trauma) were recorded. Upon completion of the simulator tests,
              participants were administered the 15 items questionnaire
              (post-test) again. Participant satisfaction data on perceived
              usefulness and accuracy of the 3D model were collected.
              Statistical analysis was performed using t-test. Data are
              reported as mean ($\pm$ standard deviation). RESULTS: Time to
              complete all tasks was 152.9 ($\pm$ 71.5) sec on the 1st attempt
              vs 98.7 ($\pm$ 40.3) sec on the 4th attempt (p=0.03). Likewise,
              quality of performance score improved from 8.3 ($\pm$ 6.7) to
              18.2 ($\pm$ 2.5) (p<0.0001). Average number of correct answers to

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Because pulmonary nodules are found in up to 25\% of
              patients undergoing computed tomography of the chest, the
              question of whether to perform biopsy is becoming increasingly
              common. Data on complications after transthoracic needle lung
              biopsy are limited to case series from selected institutions.
              OBJECTIVE: To determine population-based estimates of risks for
              complications after transthoracic needle biopsy of a pulmonary
              nodule. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis. SETTING: The 2006 State
              Ambulatory Surgery Databases and State Inpatient Databases for
              California, Florida, Michigan, and New York from the Healthcare
              Cost and Utilization Project. PATIENTS: 15 865 adults who had
              transthoracic needle biopsy of a pulmonary nodule. MEASUREMENTS:
              Percentage of biopsies complicated by hemorrhage, any
              pneumothorax, or pneumothorax requiring a chest tube, and
              adjusted odds ratios for these complications associated with
              various biopsy characteristics, calculated by using multivariate,
              population-averaged generalized estimating equations. RESULTS:
              Although hemorrhage was rare, complicating 1.0\% (95\% CI, 0.9\%
              to 1.2\%) of biopsies, 17.8\% (CI, 11.8\% to 23.8\%) of patients
              with hemorrhage required a blood transfusion. In contrast, the
              risk for any pneumothorax was 15.0\% (CI, 14.0\% to 16.0\%), and
              6.6\% (CI, 6.0\% to 7.2\%) of all biopsies resulted in
              pneumothorax requiring a chest tube. Compared with patients
              without complications, those who experienced hemorrhage or
              pneumothorax requiring a chest tube had longer lengths of stay (P
              < 0.001) and were more likely to develop respiratory failure
              requiring mechanical ventilation (P = 0.020). Patients aged 60 to
              69 years (as opposed to younger or older patients), smokers, and
              those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease had higher risk
              for complications. LIMITATIONS: Estimated risks may be inaccurate
              if coding of complications is incomplete. The analyzed databases
              contain little clinical detail (such as information on nodule
              characteristics or biopsy pathology) and cannot indicate whether
              performing the biopsy produced useful information. CONCLUSION:
              Whereas hemorrhage is an infrequent complication of transthoracic
              needle lung biopsy, pneumothorax is common and often necessitates
              chest tube placement. These population-based data should help
              patients and physicians make more informed choices about whether
              to perform biopsy of a pulmonary nodule. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE:

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Lung cancer screening with low-dose computed
              tomography (LDCT) has been recommended, based primarily on the
              results of the NLST (National Lung Screening Trial). The American
              College of Radiology recently released Lung-RADS, a
              classification system for LDCT lung cancer screening. OBJECTIVE:
              To retrospectively apply the Lung-RADS criteria to the NLST.
              DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a group from a randomized trial.
              SETTING: 33 U.S. screening centers. PATIENTS: Participants were
              randomly assigned to the LDCT group of the NLST, were aged 55 to
              74 years, had at least a 30-pack-year history of smoking, and
              were current smokers or had quit within the past 15 years.
              INTERVENTION: 3 annual LDCT lung cancer screenings. MEASUREMENTS:
              Lung-RADS classifications for LDCT screenings. Lung-RADS
              categories 1 to 2 constitute negative screening results, and
              categories 3 to 4 constitute positive results. RESULTS: Of 26 722
              LDCT group participants, 26 455 received a baseline screening; 48
              671 screenings were done after baseline. At baseline, the
              false-positive result rate (1 minus the specificity rate) for
              Lung-RADS was 12.8\% (95\% CI, 12.4\% to 13.2\%) versus 26.6\%
              (CI, 26.1\% to 27.1\%) for the NLST; after baseline, the
              false-positive result rate was 5.3\% (CI, 5.1\% to 5.5\%) for
              Lung-RADS versus 21.8\% (CI, 21.4\% to 22.2\%) for the NLST.
              Baseline sensitivity was 84.9\% (CI, 80.8\% to 89.0\%) for
              Lung-RADS versus 93.5\% (CI, 90.7\% to 96.3\%) for the NLST, and
              sensitivity after baseline was 78.6\% (CI, 74.6\% to 82.6\%) for
              Lung-RADS versus 93.8\% (CI, 91.4\% to 96.1\%) for the NLST.
              LIMITATION: Lung-RADS criteria were applied retrospectively.
              CONCLUSION: Lung-RADS may substantially reduce the false-positive
              result rate; however, sensitivity is also decreased. The effect
              of using Lung-RADS criteria in clinical practice must be
              carefully studied. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: National Institutes of

  abstract = "The two human cell lines HepG2 from hepatoma and HMCL-7304 from
              striated muscle were $\gamma$-irradiated with doses between 0 and
              4 Gy. Abundant $\gamma$H2AX foci were observed at 4 Gy after 4 h
              of culture post-irradiation. Sham-irradiated cells showed no
              $\gamma$H2AX foci and therefore no signs of radiation-induced
              double-strand DNA breaks. Flow cytometry indicated that 41.5\% of
              HepG2 cells were in G2/M and this rose statistically
              significantly with increasing radiation dose reaching a plateau
              at ∼47\%. Cell lysates from both cell lines were subjected to
              metabolomic analysis using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry
              (GCMS). A total of 46 metabolites could be identified by GCMS in
              HepG2 cell lysates and 29 in HMCL-7304 lysates, most of which
              occurred in HepG2 cells. Principal Components Analysis (PCA)
              showed a clear separation of sham, 1, 2 and 4 Gy doses.
              Orthogonal Projection to Latent Structures-Discriminant Analysis
              (OPLS-DA) revealed elevations in intracellular lactate, alanine,
              glucose, glucose 6-phosphate, fructose and 5-oxoproline, which
              were found by univariate statistics to be highly statistically
              significantly elevated at both 2 and 4 Gy compared with sham
              irradiated cells. These findings suggested upregulation of
              cytosolic aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect), with potential
              shunting of glucose through aldose reductase in the polyol
              pathway, and consumption of reduced Glutathione (GSH) due to
              $\gamma$-irradiation. In HMCL-7304 myotubes, a putative Warburg
              effect was also observed only at 2 Gy, albeit a lesser magnitude
              than in HepG2 cells. It is anticipated that these novel metabolic
              perturbations following $\gamma$-irradiation of cultured cells
              will lead to a fuller understanding of the mechanisms of tissue
              damage following ionizing radiation exposure.",

  author   = "Mathews, Maria and Bulman, Donna and Ryan, Dana",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: There is growing interest in the role of physician as
              health advocate; however, few studies have documented advocacy
              from the patient's perspective. To address this gap, we examined
              the experiences of patients with cancer from the onset of
              symptoms to the start of treatment in Newfoundland and Labrador
              and aimed to describe wait times and efforts to improve
              timeliness of care from the patients' perspective. METHODS: We
              conducted qualitative interviews with 60 participants aged 19
              years or more with breast, colorectal, lung or prostate cancer
              who were recruited from a survey of patients with cancer that was
              carried out as an earlier part of a larger study. All survey
              participants had received care at regional cancer clinics in
              Newfoundland and Labrador and were selected by means of purposive
              sampling based on their type of cancer, level of satisfaction
              with care and place of residence (urban, semiurban or rural).
              Interviews were transcribed verbatim and coded by means of a
              thematic approach. RESULTS: Participants described actions taken
              by themselves, their families/friends or members of their health
              care team to reduce their wait for a diagnosis and/or treatment.
              In all instances, participants believed that these actions
              resulted in more timely care. Participants reported that
              ``insider knowledge'' of health care professionals (whether
              friends, family members or members of the care team) was
              particularly valuable in reducing delays. INTERPRETATION: The use
              of advocacy was relatively commonplace. The role of advocacy,
              whether it originates from patient or caregiver, is important to
              ensure access to timely, good-quality cancer care.",

              use of patients admitted to general internal medicine at 7
              hospital sites in the Greater Toronto Area. METHODS: This was a
              retrospective cohort study involving all patients who were
              admitted to or discharged from general internal medicine at the
              study sites between Apr. 1, 2010, and Mar. 31, 2015. Clinical
              data from hospital electronic information systems were linked to
              administrative data from each hospital. We examined trends in
              resource use and patient characteristics over the study period.
              RESULTS: There were 136 208 admissions to general internal
              medicine involving 88 121 unique patients over the study period.
              General internal medicine admissions accounted for 38.8\% of all
              admissions from the emergency department and 23.7\% of all
              hospital bed-days. Over the study period, the number of
              admissions to general internal medicine increased by 32.4\%;
              there was no meaningful change in the median length of stay or
              cost per hospital stay. The median patient age was 73
              (interquartile range [IQR] 57-84) years, and the median number of
              coexisting conditions was 6 (IQR 3-9). The median acute length of
              stay was 4.6 (IQR 2.5-8.6) days, and the median total cost per
              hospital stay was \$5850 (IQR \$3915-\$10 061). Patients received
              at least 1 computed tomography scan in 52.2\% of admissions. The
              most common primary discharge diagnoses were pneumonia (5.0\% of
              admissions), heart failure (4.7\%), chronic obstructive pulmonary
              disease (4.1\%), urinary tract infection (4.0\%) and stroke
              (3.6\%). INTERPRETATION: Patients admitted to general internal
              medicine services represent a large, heterogeneous,
              resource-intensive and growing population. Understanding and

               eating habits that compromise physical and mental health. These
               conditions are seen in small percentages of the population in
               both men and women, but many of these disorders such as anorexia
               nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and orthorexia nervosa are seen within
               the athlete population. The majority of athletes are considered
               to be very healthy in terms of BMI, however in many sports,
               coaches and peers can place a strong emphasis on the importance
               of attaining unrealistic weights in order to excel. This can
               significantly impact the athlete's relationship with food and
               lead to a distorted body image. This review looked at how
               different categories of restricted eating and eating disorders
               cause long-term deterioration of sport performance due to
               subsequent muscle deterioration. Athletes and coaches should be
               educated on the proper nutrition requirements for strenuous
               athletic performance and how to deal with the stress of the lean
               culture of certain sports. Motivating athletes to improve other
               aspects of the sport such as fitness, strength, and endurance
               are healthier ways to improve performance without emphasising
               weight loss that can lead to disordered eating.",

  abstract = "Background: Yale-New Haven Hospital (YNHH) began a successful
              journey to achieve safe patient flow in fiscal year (FY) 2008
              (October 1, 2007--September 30, 2008). The 966-bed (now
              1,541-bed) academic medical center faced several challenges,
              including overcrowding in the Adult Emergency Department (ED);
              delays in the postanesthesia care unit, which affected the flow
              of patients through the operating rooms; pinched capacity during
              the central part of the day; and a lack of interdependent
              institutionwide coordination of patients. Methods: The Safe
              Patient Flow Steering Committee oversaw improvement efforts, most
              of which were implemented in FY 2009 (October 2008--September
              2009), through a cascade of operational meetings. Process changes
              were made in various departments, such as the Adult ED,
              Physicians/Providers, and the Bed Management Department.
              Organizationwide method changes involved standardizing the
              discharge process, using status boards for visual control, and
              improving accuracy and timeliness of data entry. Results: Between
              FY 2008 and FY 2011, YNHH experienced an 84\% improvement in
              discharges by 11:00 A.M. The average length of stay decreased
              from 5.23 to 5.05 days, thereby accommodating an additional 45
              inpatients on a daily basis, contributing to YNHH's positive
              operating margin amid increasing volume and overall decreasing
              inpatient length of stay. Conclusions: YNHH improved clinical,
              operational, and financial outcomes by embracing five key
              components of demand capacity management: real-time
              communication, inter/intradepartmental and interdisciplinary
              collaboration, staff empowerment, standardization of best

              1000 kJ (240 kcal) servings of 38 foods separated into six food
              categories (fruits, bakery products, snack foods,
              carbohydrate-rich foods, protein-rich foods, breakfast cereals)
              were fed to groups of 11-13 subjects. Satiety ratings were
              obtained every 15 min over 120 min after which subjects were free
              to eat ad libitum from a standard range of foods and drinks. A
              satiety index (SI) score was calculated by dividing the area
              under the satiety response curve (AUC) for the test food by the
              group mean satiety AUC for white bread and multiplying by 100.
              Thus, white bread had an SI score of 100\% and the SI scores of
              the other foods were expressed as a percentage of white bread.
              RESULTS: There were significant differences in satiety both
              within and between the six food categories. The highest SI score
              was produced by boiled potatoes (323 +/- 51\%) which was
              seven-fold higher than the lowest SI score of the croissant (47
              +/- 17\%). Most foods (76\%) had an SI score greater than or
              equal to white bread. The amount of energy eaten immediately

              responses (r = -0.37, P < 0.05, n = 43) thereby supporting the
              subjective satiety ratings. SI scores correlated positively with

              payers are seeking methods to improve the hospital care of
              patients. This study's purpose was to examine the length of stay
              and cost of inpatient care by a family medicine teaching service
              in comparison with the hospitalists' and community physicians'
              services in the same community hospital. METHODS: We analyzed
              inpatient admissions to either a family medicine teaching service
              (FMTS), hospitalist physician group, or the patient's own primary
              care community physician in a 290-bed, for-profit, community
              hospital over a 12-month period. Outcome variables investigated
              included length of stay, fixed costs, variable costs, and
              readmission rate. RESULTS: A total of 5,453 hospital admissions
              were analyzed. Patients admitted to the FMTS experienced a
              significantly shorter length of stay and had significantly lower
              fixed, variable, and total costs per admission. No significant
              differences in readmission rates were noted. CONCLUSIONS: The
              care provided by a teaching service as indicated by length of

              Prospective, non-randomized controlled trial. SETTING W est Winds
              Primary Health Centre, an interdisciplinary health centre that
              includes an academic family medicine practice, located in
              Saskatoon, Sask. PARTICIPANTS All patients whose pharmacies faxed
              the health centre requesting prescription renewals between
              October 2007 and February 2008 were selected to participate in
              the study. INTERVENTIONS Medication renewal requests were
              forwarded to the pharmacist (who works in the clinic part-time)
              on days when he was working (intervention group). The pharmacist
              assessed drug-therapy issues that might preclude safe and
              effective prescribing of the medication. The pharmacist and
              physician then made a collaborative decision to authorize the
              requested medication or to request additional interventions first
              (eg, perform laboratory tests). When the pharmacist was not
              working, the physicians managed the renewal requests
              independently (control group). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Medication
              renewals authorized with no recommendations, medication-related
              problems identified, new monitoring tests ordered, and new
              appointments scheduled with health providers. RESULTS A total of
              181 renewal requests were included (94 in the control group and
              87 in the intervention group). The control group had
              significantly more requests authorized with no recommendations
              (75.5\% vs 52.9\%, P = .001). Those in the intervention group had
              significantly more medication-related problems identified (26 vs
              10, P = .031); medication changes made (24 vs 10, P = .044); and
              new appointments scheduled with their family physicians (31 vs
              21, P = .049). CONCLUSION There is an improvement in medication
              management when a pharmacist collaborates with family physicians
              to prescribe medication renewals. The collaborative model created
              significantly more activity with each renewal request (ie,
              identification of medication-related problems, medication
              changes, and new appointments), which reflects an improvement in

               a clear position for the use of prospective in this discipline.
               We propose to structure ergonomic activities around corrective,
               preventive (design) and prospective ergonomics, where the latter
               looks forward in time to defining human needs and activities so
               as to create human-centered artifacts that are useful and
               provide a positive user experience. The place of prospective
               ergonomics is upstream of projects, before a problem or request
               is raised by a client, and before projects exist. We describe
               several characteristics of prospective ergonomics and compare
               them with those of corrective and preventive ergonomics. We show
               that prospective ergonomics has major impacts on education and
               practice, since ergonomists should not only be trained as human
               factor experts but also as strategists to reflect on the future
               and as project managers. Prospective ergonomics requires the
               ``intelligence analysis'' of a lot of data and experts'
               opinions, as well as perspicacity, intuition, creativity,
               motivation and initiative. It represents a huge potential for
               the advancement and evolution of ergonomics and for the

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND AIM: This study attempts to estimate the
              socioeconomic differences between three major alternatives for
              the management of upper and lower ureteral lithiasis. MATERIAL
              AND METHODS: Two hundred and forty patients with upper and lower
              ureteral lithiasis, have been studied retrospectively, divided in
              six equal groups of forty. These patients have been treated
              either by extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (SWL), or with
              ureteroscopy with semirigid ureteroscope and the use of pneumatic
              lithoclast, or with ureteroscopy with flexible ureteroscope and
              the use of Holmium YAG Laser. For cost calculation, the
              reimbursement fee paid by insurance to the hospital was taken
              into account. For the estimation of the social burden, the length
              of hospital stay and the number of outpatient visits have been
              included as countable parameters. RESULTS: The percentage of
              effective stone removal for upper ureter was 81.0\% for SWL,
              62.5\% for ureteroscopy with semirigid ureteroscope and the use
              of pneumatic lithoclast and, 82.5\% for ureteroscopy with
              flexible ureteroscope and the use of Holmium YAG Laser. The same
              percentages for lower ureter were 82.5\%, 92.5\% and 97.5\%
              respectively. The cost of stone removal for both the upper and
              lower ureter using extracorporeal lithotripsy was significantly
              higher compared to the other two procedures (median cost for
              upper ureter 828 € vs 474.50 € and 396 € respectively, and for
              lower ureter 826 € vs 396 € and 271 €, p<0.001). Regarding the
              social aspect, SWL is mainly an outpatient procedure, requiring a
              short hospital stay (for upper ureter 1.63 vs 2.48 and 2.45
              respectively and for lower ureter 1.35 vs 2.43 and 2.13days), but
              needing more and prevailing clinic visits (for upper ureter 1.43
              vs 1.45 and 1 respectively and for lower ureter 1.45 vs 1.15 and
              0.55 visitsgive numbers, compare), both in outpatient and in
              accident and emergency (A\&E) department. CONCLUSION: The
              increase in the expenses with regard to health management
              indicates the necessity of cost accounting the health programs
              including the medical procedures as a means to improve the
              relation between cost and benefit.",

              Following this, the 'LCP Pilot Project' was developed. This

              parameters of Bayes' theorem can be combined with a value
              function of health states to arrive at informed test and
              treatment desisions. The authors distinguish between
              risk-neutral, risk-averse and prudent decision makers and
              demonstrate the effects of risk preferences on
              physicians'decisions. They analyze individual tests, multiple
              tests and endogenous tests where the test outcome is chosen by
              the decision maker. Moreover, the topic is examined in the
              context of health economics by introducing a trade-off between
              enjoying health and consuming other goods, so that the extent of
              treatment and thus the potential improvement in the patient's
              health becomes endogenous. Finally, non-expected utility models
              of choice under risk and unvertainty (i.e, ambiguity) are
              presented. While these models can explain observed test and
              treatment decisions, they are not suitable for normative analyses
              aimed at providing guidance on medical decision making. »--",

  abstract = "The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have emerged
              as a major therapeutic advance in psychopharmacology. As a
              result, the discovery of these agents marks a milestone in
              neuropsychopharmacology and rational drug design, and has
              launched a new era in psychotropic drug development. Prior to the
              SSRIs, all psychotropic medications were the result of chance
              observation. In an attempt to develop a SSRI, researchers
              discovered a number of nontricyclic agents with amine-uptake
              inhibitory properties, acting on both noradrenergic and
              serotonergic neurons with considerable differences in potency. A
              given drug may affect one or more sites over its clinically
              relevant dosing range and may produce multiple and different
              clinical effects. The enhanced safety profile includes a reduced
              likelihood of pharmacodynamically mediated adverse drug-drug
              interactions by avoiding affects on sites that are not essential
              to the intended outcome. SSRIs were developed for inhibition of
              the neuronal uptake pump for serotonin (5-HT), a property shared
              with the TCAs, but without affecting the other various
              neuroreceptors or fast sodium channels. The therapeutic mechanism
              of action of SSRIs involves alteration in the 5-HT system. The
              plethora of biological substrates, receptors and pathways for
              5-HT are candidates to mediate not only the therapeutic actions
              of SSRIs, but also their side effects. A hypothesis to explain
              these immediate side effects is that 5-HT is increased at
              specific 5-HT receptor subtypes in discrete regions of the body
              where the relevant physiologic processes are regulated. Marked
              differences exist between the SSRIs with regard to effects on
              specific cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, and thus the likelihood
              of clinically important pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions.
              Although no clear relationship exists between the clinical
              efficacy, plasma concentration of SSRIs, nor any threshold that
              defines toxic concentrations, but therapeutic drug monitoring
              (TDM) may be useful in special populations, such as in elderly
              patients, poor metabolizers (PM) of sparteine (CYP2D6) or
              mephenytoin (CYP2C19), and patients with liver and kidney
              impairment. Several meta-analyses have reviewed the comparative
              efficacy of TCAs and SSRIs, and concluded that both TCAs and
              SSRIs have similar efficacy in the treatment of depression. SSRIs
              have demonstrated better efficacy and tolerability in the
              treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). They have also
              been found to be effective in the treatment for social anxiety
              disorder both in reducing total levels of social anxiety and in
              improving overall clinical condition. The benefit of SSRIs in
              anorexia nervosa (AN) is apparently short-term unless medication
              is given in the context of nutritional or behavioral therapy. No
              single antidepressant can ever be recommended for every patient,
              but in a vast majority of patients, SSRIs should be considered as
              one of the first-line drugs in the treatment of depression.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Orthorexia, from the Greek words orthos (straight,
              proper) and orexis (appetite), is a newly conceptualized disorder
              characterized by distorted eating habits and cognitions
              concerning supposedly healthy nutrition. In this article we
              present preliminary results of a wider research aimed to
              investigate the diffusion of Orthorexia in the general population
              and to highlight its characteristics and particularly the
              relationship with Eating Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive
              Disorder. METHOD: One-hundred and seventy seven adult subjects
              from the general population, were administered the ORTO-15 test,
              a selfadministered questionnaire specifically designed to assess
              orthorexic symptomatology; note that statistical analyses were
              repeated twice, referring to different diagnostic thresholds
              (40/35). RESULTS: Orthorexia had a 57.6\% prevalence in our
              sample, using the 40-point threshold, with a female/male ratio
              2:1; the figure was sensibly lower with the 35-point threshold
              (21\%). CONCLUSION: The results of this study highlight the
              diffusion of Orthorexia which may constitute an important risk
              factor for mental and physical health, but also the opportunity
              of more specific diagnostic instruments, so to facilitate a
              thorough understanding of this disorder.",

              The result is obtained by using a rigid hollow split sheath for
              the scope. The split sheath has two separate channels. One
              channel is for irrigation and the cleaning fluid flows through

              for suction to remove the solution and debris during and after

              paper, we report on a new instrument to assess this: the
              Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ). Individuals score in the range
              0-50. Four groups of subjects were assessed: Group 1: 58 adults
              with Asperger syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism (HFA);
              Group 2: 174 randomly selected controls. Group 3: 840 students in
              Cambridge University; and Group 4: 16 winners of the UK
              Mathematics Olympiad. The adults with AS/HFA had a mean AQ score
              of 35.8 (SD = 6.5), significantly higher than Group 2 controls (M
              = 16.4, SD = 6.3). 80\% of the adults with AS/HFA scored 32+,
              versus 2\% of controls. Among the controls, men scored slightly
              but significantly higher than women. No women scored extremely
              highly (AQ score 34+) whereas 4\% of men did so. Twice as many
              men (40\%) as women (21\%) scored at intermediate levels (AQ
              score 20+). Among the AS/HFA group, male and female scores did
              not differ significantly. The students in Cambridge University
              did not differ from the randomly selected control group, but
              scientists (including mathematicians) scored significantly higher
              than both humanities and social sciences students, confirming an
              earlier study that autistic conditions are associated with
              scientific skills. Within the sciences, mathematicians scored
              highest. This was replicated in Group 4, the Mathematics Olympiad
              winners scoring significantly higher than the male Cambridge
              humanities students. 6\% of the student sample scored 32+ on the
              AQ. On interview, 11 out of 11 of these met three or more DSM-IV
              criteria for AS/HFA, and all were studying sciences/mathematics,
              and 7 of the 11 met threshold on these criteria. Test-retest and
              interrater reliability of the AQ was good. The AQ is thus a
              valuable instrument for rapidly quantifying where any given
              individual is situated on the continuum from autism to normality.

  abstract = "Participants in the sport of bodybuilding are judged by
              appearance rather than performance. In this respect, increased
              muscle size and definition are critical elements of success. The
              purpose of this review is to evaluate the literature and provide
              recommendations regarding macronutrient intake during both
              'off-season' and 'pre-contest' phases. Body builders attempt to
              increase muscle mass during the off-season (no competitive
              events), which may be the great majority of the year. During the
              off-season, it is advantageous for the bodybuilder to be in
              positive energy balance so that extra energy is available for
              muscle anabolism. Additionally, during the off-season, adequate
              protein must be available to provide amino acids for protein
              synthesis. For 6-12 weeks prior to competition, body builders
              attempt to retain muscle mass and reduce body fat to very low
              levels. During the pre-contest phase, the bodybuilder should be
              in negative energy balance so that body fat can be oxidised.
              Furthermore, during the pre-contest phase, protein intake must be
              adequate to maintain muscle mass. There is evidence that a
              relatively high protein intake (approximately 30\% of energy
              intake) will reduce lean mass loss relative to a lower protein
              intake (approximately 15\% of energy intake) during energy
              restriction. The higher protein intake will also provide a
              relatively large thermic effect that may aid in reducing body
              fat. In both the off-season and pre-contest phases, adequate
              dietary carbohydrate should be ingested (55-60\% of total energy
              intake) so that training intensity can be maintained. Excess
              dietary saturated fat can exacerbate coronary artery disease;
              however, low-fat diets result in a reduction in circulating
              testosterone. Thus, we suggest dietary fats comprise 15-20\% of
              the body builders' off-season and pre-contest diets. Consumption
              of protein/amino acids and carbohydrate immediately before and
              after training sessions may augment protein synthesis, muscle
              glycogen resynthesis and reduce protein degradation. The optimal
              rate of carbohydrate ingested immediately after a training
              session should be 1.2 g/kg/hour at 30-minute intervals for 4
              hours and the carbohydrate should be of high glycaemic index. In
              summary, the composition of diets for body builders should be
              55-60\% carbohydrate, 25-30\% protein and 15-20\% of fat, for
              both the off-season and pre-contest phases. During the off-season
              the diet should be slightly hyperenergetic (approximately 15\%
              increase in energy intake) and during the pre-contest phase the
              diet should be hypoenergetic (approximately 15\% decrease in
              energy intake).",

              participating supervisees were receiving supervision from one of
              the participating supervisors at the time this study took place.
              Data were collected through individual, semi-structured
              interviews and a demographic information sheet. Data were
              analyzed using a phenomenological framework, which involved
              coding transcribed interviews and organizing codes into themes

              discussion, supervisor's role in addressing cultural issues,
              degree of intentionality, and scope of attention to culture.
              Participants also described positive and negative experiences
              with attention to cultural issues in supervision and the impact
              of these experiences on the supervisory relationship. Themes

              cohesion/bonding, safety, and awareness. Themes associated with
              the impact of negative experiences include supervisee withdrawal,
              decreased feelings of competence, and improvement. Participants

               time and financial commitment, but helpful, goal-oriented
               therapy can produce positive results after only a few sessions.
               Solution-focused brief therapy (SFBT) has been gaining momentum
               as a powerful therapeutic approach since its inception in the
               1980s. By focusing on solutions instead of problems, it asks
               clients to set concrete goals and to draw upon strengths in
               their lives that can help bring about the desired change for a
               preferred future. Addressing both researchers and practitioners,
               a distinguished cast of international, interdisciplinary
               contributors review the current state of research on SFBT
               interventions and illustrate its applications---both proven and

               domestic violence offenders, troubled and runaway youth,
               students, adults with substance abuse problems, and clients with
               schizophrenia. This expansive text also includes a treatment
               manual, strengths-based and fidelity measures, and detailed
               descriptions on how to best apply SFBT to underscore the
               strengths, skills, and resources that clients may unknowingly

              PubMed. RESULTS: A 38-year old South East Asian woman with a
              5-year history of AN restrictive subtype was admitted to the
              eating disorders unit. During her admission, she received

               type and duration of exercise during a full menstrual cycle.
               Menstrual cycle phases were determined by the presence of
               menses, ovarian hormonal assays, and basal temperature
               monitoring. Reports of pain, water retention, negative affect,

               and luteal phases. During the perimenstruum, a higher energy

               negative affect (p < .01) and impaired performance/decreased
               activity (p < .05). Lower energy intake of protein was
               associated with higher ratings of well being (p < .05).

              their methodologic rigour are proposed. They are based on the
              quality of the methods used to estimate clinical effectiveness,
              quality of life and costs. With the use of the magnitude of the
              incremental net benefit of a technology, therapies can also be

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Orthorexia is a pathological fixation about the
              consumption of healthy food. The present study aimed to reveal
              the psychometric properties of the Turkish version of ORTO-15,
              which was developed to evaluate orthorexia, and to investigate
              the relationship betweenorthorexia, and eating attitude,
              obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and some demographic variables.
              METHOD: The study included 994 participants aged between 19 and
              66 years. ORTO-15, the Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory,
              and the Eating Attitude Test-40 were administered to the
              participants. RESULTS: A 3-factor solution with varimax rotation
              explained 40.62\% of the variance. When 4 items with factor
              loadings below+/- 0.50 were eliminated from ORTO-15, the
              Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.62. The remaining 11 items
              were thought to have statistically satisfactory properties for
              the Turkish version of ORTO and were collectively referred to as
              ORTO-11. This version was used to investigate the relationship
              between orthorexia, and eating attitude and obsessive-compulsive
              symptoms. Pathological eating attitude and obsessive-compulsive
              symptoms were related to orthorexia. Women exhibited more
              orthorexic symptoms then men. In the present study high a body
              mass index was an important variable for orthorexia, but only
              together with gender (female), pathological eating attitude, and
              increased obsessive-compulsive symptoms. The results,
              implications, and limitations of the study are discussed.
              CONCLUSION: ORTO-11 demonstrated statistically satisfactory
              properties. Orthorexia was related to pathological eating
              attitude and obsessive-compulsive symptoms; however, caution
              should be used when generalizing the reported results.",

              Cosmetic Act in 1938 and escalating with the 1962 Kefauver-Harris
              amendments, increasing pressure has been placed on pharmaceutical
              manufacturers to demonstrate that a drug's benefits outweigh its
              risks. Nowhere has the question of risk versus benefit come under
              greater scrutiny than with anorectics. After the approval in the
              1940s and 1950s of a number of amphetamine and amphetamine-like
              compounds for the treatment of obesity, the U.S. Food and Drug
              Administration struggled to define the efficacy and safety of
              these agents. Labeling restrictions on duration of use and
              warnings about abuse and addiction ultimately contributed to the
              reduced use of anorectics. That trend continued until the
              mid-1990s, when the off-label use of fenfluramine plus
              phentermine (fen-phen) and the approval of dexfenfluramine gave
              rise to widespread, long-term use of anorectics to treat obesity.
              The adverse effects that came to be associated with fenfluramine
              and dexfenfluramine, leading to their eventual withdrawal from
              the market, gave pause to regulators, physicians, patients, and
              drug companies alike. Sibutramine, the latest anorectic to enter
              the market, is now the focus of a landmark trial that is
              examining, for the first time, whether drug-induced weight loss

               however, it was not until the medieval ages that food was
               considered a tool to modify temperament and mood, although
               scientific methods as we know them today were not in use at the
               time. Modern scientific methods in neuroscience began to emerge
               much later, leading investigators to examine the role of diet in
               health, including mental wellbeing, with greater precision. This
               review shows how short- and long-term forced dietary
               interventions bring about changes in brain structure, chemistry,
               and physiology, leading to altered animal behavior. Examples
               will be presented to show how diets alter brain chemistry,
               behavior, and the action of neuroactive drugs. Most humans and
               most animal species examined in a controlled setting exhibit a
               fairly reproducible pattern of what and how they eat. Recent
               data suggest that these patterns may be under the neurochemical
               and hormonal control of the organisms themselves. Other data
               show that in many instances food may be used unconsciously to
               regulate mood by seemingly normal subjects as well as those
               undergoing drug withdrawal or experiencing seasonal affective
               disorders and obesity-related social withdrawal. We will discuss
               specific examples that illustrate that manipulation of dietary

              hemiparesis in the right upper extremity and profound ataxia in
              the left upper extremity. Due to the severity of these
              disabilities, the client required total assistance at every meal

  abstract = "The Behavioral Satiety Sequence (BSS) is the name given to the
              orderly transitions of eating, activity grooming and resting
              measured during the postingestive period. Because the BSS is
              considered to reflect the operations of natural physiological
              processes underlying satiety, the sequence can be used to
              discriminate between different drugs (and other manipulations)
              that reduce food intake via these natural physiological
              mechanisms or those that do so by interference. The BSS is only
              produced by the presence of a caloric load in the gut, and the
              preabsorptive satiety factors (such as CCK) the caloric load
              triggers. The BSS is most accurately defined by continuous
              observation rather than time or event sampling techniques
              [Partial Time Sampling (PTS) or Momentary Time Sampling (MTS)].
              Continuous observation also allows the true duration and true
              frequency of each behavior to be analyzed. Continuous observation
              can be used to determine if the profiles associated with the
              reduction in food intake is caused by nausea, sedation,
              hyperactivity, or altered palatability of food. At the present
              time is it possible to identify a number of drugs whose
              suppression of food intake is associated with the disruption or
              preservation of the BSS. Drugs that increase synaptic 5-HT
              activity such d-fenfluramine, fluoxetine. and sibutramine all
              preserve the BSS and advance the onset of resting. The 5-HT1b/2c
              agonists mCPP and TFMPP and the 5-HT1b agonist CP-94,253 produce
              similar effects. However, the 5-HT2 agonist DOI and the 5-HT1a/1b
              agonist RU-24969 disrupt the BSS by inducing hyperactivity as
              does amphetamine. The 5-HT2 agonist MK-212 disrupts the BSS by
              inducing sedation. Selective dopamine agonists, at low doses,
              such as SKF-38393 (DA1) and LY-171555 (DA2) also preserve the
              BSS. However, detailed behavioral analysis of the effects of many
              recently discovered putative satiety factors remains to be

              40\%-50\% recovery rate. Most of these reviews have focused on
              reductions of binge eating and purging; however, the cognitive
              model of BN that underlies the CBT approach identifies three

              restraint and self-esteem. While generally favorable, evidence

  abstract  = "Popularized by Michael Pollan in his best-selling In Defense of
               Food, Gyorgy Scrinis's concept of nutritionism refers to the
               reductive understanding of nutrients as the key indicators of
               healthy food -- an approach that has dominated nutrition
               science, dietary advice, and food marketing. Scrinis argues this
               ideology has narrowed and in some cases distorted our
               appreciation of food quality, such that even highly processed
               foods may be perceived as healthful depending on their content
               of ``good'' or ``bad'' nutrients. Investigating the butter
               versus margarine debate, the battle between low-fat, low-carb,
               and other weight-loss diets, and the food industry's strategic
               promotion of nutritionally enhanced foods, Scrinis reveals the
               scientific, social, and economic factors driving our modern
               fascination with nutrition.Scrinis develops an original
               framework and terminology for analyzing the characteristics and
               consequences of nutritionism since the late nineteenth century.
               He begins with the era of quantification, in which the idea of
               protective nutrients, caloric reductionism, and vitamins'
               curative effects took shape. He follows with the era of good and
               bad nutritionism, which set nutricentric dietary guidelines and
               defined the parameters of unhealthy nutrients; and concludes
               with our current era of functional nutritionism, in which the
               focus has shifted to targeted nutrients, superfoods, and optimal
               diets. Scrinis's research underscores the critical role of
               nutrition science and dietary advice in shaping our relationship
               to food and our bodies and in heightening our nutritional
               anxieties. He ultimately shows how nutritionism has aligned the
               demands and perceived needs of consumers with the commercial
               interests of food manufacturers and corporations. Scrinis also
               offers an alternative paradigm for assessing the healthfulness
               of foods -- the food quality paradigm -- that privileges food
               production and processing quality, cultural-traditional
               knowledge, and sensual-practical experience, and promotes less
               reductive forms of nutrition research and dietary advice.",

              SETTING: Intensive care units of Barnes-Jewish Hospital, an urban
              teaching hospital. PATIENTS: 521 patients requiring mechanical
              ventilation in an ICU for >12 hours. INTERVENTIONS: Prospective

              duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay in the ICU and
              the hospital, and acquired organ-system derangements. Fifty-one
              (9.8\%) patients received a tracheostomy. The hospital mortality
              of patients with a tracheostomy was statistically less than the
              hospital mortality of patients not receiving a tracheostomy
              (13.7\% vs. 26.4\%; p = .048), despite having a similar severity
              of illness at the time of admission to the ICU (Acute Physiology
              and Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE] II scores, 19.2 +/- 6.1
              vs. 17.8 +/- 7.2; p = .173). Patients receiving a tracheostomy
              had significantly longer durations of mechanical ventilation

              .001) compared with patients not receiving a tracheostomy.
              Similarly, the average duration of intensive care was
              significantly longer among the hospital nonsurvivors receiving a
              tracheostomy (n = 7) compared with the hospital nonsurvivors
              without a tracheostomy (n = 124; 30.9 +/- 16.3 days vs. 7.9 +/-
              7.3 days; p < .001). Multiple logistic regression analysis
              demonstrated that the development of nosocomial pneumonia
              (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 4.72; 95\% confidence interval [CI],
              3.24-6.87; p < .001), the administration of aerosol treatments
              (AOR, 3.00; 95\% CI, 2.184.13; p < .001), having a witnessed
              aspiration event (AOR, 3.79; 95\% CI, 2.30-6.24; p = .008), and
              requiring reintubation (AOR, 2.21; 95\% CI, 1.54-3.18; p = .028)
              were variables independently associated with patients undergoing
              tracheostomy and receiving prolonged ventilatory support. Among
              the 44 survivors receiving a tracheostomy in the ICU, 38 (86.4\%)
              were alive 30 days after hospital discharge and 31 (70.5\%) were
              living at home. CONCLUSIONS: Despite having longer lengths of
              stay in the ICU and hospital, patients with respiratory failure
              who received a tracheostomy had favorable outcomes compared with
              patients who did not receive a tracheostomy. These data suggest
              that physicians are capable of selecting critically ill patients
              who most likely will benefit from placement of a tracheostomy.
              Additionally, specific clinical variables were identified as risk

              objective advice to the general public, yet their personal
              beliefs and behaviors could influence delivery of nutrition care.
              Increased understanding of the personal attitudes and behaviors
              of dietitians concerning eating behavior and body image could
              help improve dietetic practice. Traditional nutrition education
              emphasizes cognitive eating, i.e., monitoring energy intake and
              comparing macronutrient intakes to the current acceptable ranges.
              Intuitive eating, however, promotes the release of cognitive
              eating in favor of greater attention to physiologic cues, or
              ``body wisdom''. We hypothesized that nutrition students in a
              traditional curriculum would report eating less intuitively than
              non-nutrition majors. We surveyed 258 female undergraduate
              students (96 nutrition majors and 162 non-majors) at the
              University of Massachusetts Amherst. Using Mann-Whitney U tests,
              we assessed the differences between nutrition majors and
              non-majors in terms of: intuitive eating, as measured by the
              Intuitive Eating Scale-2 (IES-2); body mass index (BMI, kg/m2);
              magnitude of body dissatisfaction (actual weight -- ideal
              weight); and dieting behavior. We also used non-parametric
              Spearman's rho correlations and Chi-squared statistics to examine
              relationships between variables. A two-way between-groups
              analysis of variance was used to calculate statistical
              differences in intuitive eating scores between diet behavior and
              major. Contrary to our working hypothesis, we found that IES-2
              scores were significantly higher in majors versus non-majors (p=
              0.01) and significantly lower (pnormalor underweight BMI. These
              observations provide novel information indicating that nutrition
              undergraduate students, who have the intention of becoming
              registered dietitians, report that they eat more intuitively and
              have a lower degree of body dissatisfaction than do undergraduate
              students not majoring in nutrition. Additional research is needed

              systems and primary care physicians (PCPs) is a goal of most
              healthcare systems, but little direction exists on how this can
              be achieved. This study systematically examined the extent of
              integration between PCPs and a regional cancer program (RCP) to
              identify opportunities for improvement. METHOD: Cross-sectional
              survey of all practising PCPs in the region of interest using a
              study-specific instrument based on a three-tier conceptualization
              of integration. RESULTS: Among the 473 PCPs who responded (63\%
              response rate), perceived role clarity and the desire for greater
              involvement in patient care varied across the care trajectory.
              Specific gaps were identified in PCPs' understanding of the
              referral process and patient follow-up after treatment.
              CONCLUSION: Our novel survey of PCPs explicated the strategies
              that could improve their integration in cancer care, including
              mechanisms to support PCPs in the initial diagnosis of their
              patients and standardized post-treatment transition plans

              terms. All levels of evidence and types of reports were reviewed.

              within one month, contraindications, oncological efficacy,
              morbidity rates, and follow-up strategies. CONCLUSION: The
              technique is safe and effective. Tumors < 2.5 cm are
              statistically most likely to remain disease-free. Anterior tumors
              are contraindicated. Strict follow-up is needed to detect
              failures, most of which occur within 3 months and can be easily
              salvaged with repeat radiofrequency ablation. Homogeneous
              enhancement within 1 month is not necessarily a failure, and
              tends to disappear after 4 to 6 weeks. Multi-disciplinary

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Orthorexia nervosa (Greek: ortho--correct, right;
              orexis--appetite, desire) is a term introduced in 1997 by the
              American doctor Steven Bratman and is defined as a pathological
              fixation with righteous and healthy eating. Clear classification
              criteria oforthorexia have not been developed yet and there has
              been an on-going discussion whether it belongs to the group of
              eating disorders or the obsessive-compulsive disorders. AIM: The
              aim of this paper is to summarise briefly the current state of
              knowledge regarding orthorexia and to point out the difficulties
              connected with an attempt to classify it in a given disorders
              group as well as with the attempt to establish the classification
              criteria. DISCUSSION: Despite the fact that the problem of
              orthorexia has been signalled in the Polish media, it has neither
              been discussed nor published in the Polish medical literature
              yet. Orthorexia starts when a diet becomes an escape from
              life--everyday activities are dominated by planning, buying and
              preparing ``proper'' meals. Each departure from this regime
              causes anxiety and guilty conscience and leads to even further
              tightening of the dietary habits. According to Bratmann,
              orthorexia is connected with an illusory feeling of safety
              (preventing from diseases), the urge to exercise a full control
              over one's life (elimination of the unpredictable), ``a hidden
              conformism'' (eating philosophy helps in a subconscious way to
              achieve a culturally accepted model of a beautiful body), a
              search for spirituality and identity, and a desire for
              self-deprivation. CONCLUSIONS: The arguments presented in this
              paper substantiate the expediency of implementing the
              epidemiological studies which will show the scale of the problem,
              its prevalence and conditionings. Data obtained in this way
              should facilitate the verification of classification criteria and
              will also help to formulate the diagnostic criteria of
              orthorexia.",

  abstract = "Over 35 years of research suggests that endogenous hypothalamic
              serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) plays an important part in
              within-meal satiation and post-meal satiety processes. Thus, the
              serotonin system has provided a viable target for weight control,
              critical to the action of at least two effective anti-obesity
              treatments, both producing clinically significant weight loss
              over a year or more. Numerous serotonin receptor subtypes have
              been identified; of these, serotonin 5-HT1B and 5-HT2C receptors
              have been specifically recognised as mediators of
              serotonin-induced satiety.A number of serotonergic drugs,
              including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs),
              dexfenfluramine and 5-HT2C receptor agonists, have been shown to
              significantly attenuate rodent bodyweight gain. This effect is
              strongly associated with marked hypophagia and is probably
              mediated by the hypothalamic melanocortin system. Additionally,
              sibutramine, dexfenfluramine, fluoxetine and the 5-HT2C receptor
              agonist chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) have all been shown to
              modify appetite in both lean and obese humans, resulting in
              reduced caloric intake. Clinical studies demonstrate serotonergic
              drugs specifically reduce appetite prior to and following the
              consumption of fixed caloric loads, and cause a reduction in
              pre-meal appetite and caloric intake at ad libitum meals. Weight
              loss in the obese has also been produced by treatment with both
              the serotonin precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan and the preferential
              5-HT2C receptor agonist mCPP.A new generation of 5-HT2C receptor
              selective agonists have been developed and at least one,
              lorcaserin (APD356), is currently undergoing clinical trials. In
              addition, 5-HT6 receptor antagonists such as PRX-07034 and
              BVT74316 have been shown to potently reduce food intake and
              bodyweight gain in rodent models and have recently entered
              clinical trials. However, the role of the 5-HT6 receptor in the
              expression of appetite remains to be determined. The hope is that
              these drugs will not only be free of their predecessors' adverse
              effect profiles, but will also be equally or more effective at
              regulating appetite and controlling bodyweight.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness
              of coil embolization compared with surgical clipping to treat
              intracranial aneurysms. THE TECHNOLOGY: Endovascular coil
              embolization is a percutaneous approach to treat an intracranial
              aneurysm from within the blood vessel without the need of a
              craniotomy. In this procedure, a microcatheter is inserted into
              the femoral artery near the groin and navigated to the site of
              the aneurysm. Small helical platinum coils are deployed through
              the microcatheter to fill the aneurysm, and prevent it from
              further expansion and rupture. Health Canada has approved
              numerous types of coils and coil delivery systems to treat
              intracranial aneurysms. The most favoured are controlled
              detachable coils. Coil embolization may be used with other
              adjunct endovascular devices such as stents and balloons.
              BACKGROUND: INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS: Intracranial aneurysms are
              the dilation or ballooning of part of a blood vessel in the
              brain. Intracranial aneurysms range in size from small (25 mm).
              There are 3 main types of aneurysms. Fusiform aneurysms involve
              the entire circumference of the artery; saccular aneurysms have
              outpouchings; and dissecting aneurysms have tears in the arterial
              wall. Berry aneurysms are saccular aneurysms with well-defined
              necks. Intracranial aneurysms may occur in any blood vessel of
              the brain; however, they are most commonly found at the branch
              points of large arteries that form the circle of Willis at the
              base of the brain. In 85\% to 95\% of patients, they are found in
              the anterior circulation. Aneurysms in the posterior circulation
              are less frequent, and are more difficult to treat surgically due
              to inaccessibility. Most intracranial aneurysms are small and
              asymptomatic. Large aneurysms may have a mass effect, causing
              compression on the brain and cranial nerves and neurological
              deficits. When an intracranial aneurysm ruptures and bleeds,
              resulting in a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), the mortality rate
              can be 40\% to 50\%, with severe morbidity of 10\% to 20\%. The
              reported overall risk of rupture is 1.9\% per year and is higher
              for women, cigarette smokers, and cocaine users, and in aneurysms
              that are symptomatic, greater than 10 mm in diameter, or located
              in the posterior circulation. If left untreated, there is a
              considerable risk of repeat hemorrhage in a ruptured aneurysm
              that results in increased mortality. In Ontario, intracranial
              aneurysms occur in about 1\% to 4\% of the population, and the
              annual incidence of SAH is about 10 cases per 100,000 people. In
              2004-2005, about 660 intracranial aneurysm repairs were performed
              in Ontario. TREATMENT OF INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS: Treatment of an
              unruptured aneurysm attempts to prevent the aneurysm from
              rupturing. The treatment of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm aims
              to prevent further hemorrhage. There are 3 approaches to treating
              an intracranial aneurysm. Small, asymptomatic aneurysms less than
              10 mm in diameter may be monitored without any intervention other
              than treatment for underlying risk factors such as hypertension.
              Open surgical clipping, involves craniotomy, brain retraction,
              and placement of a silver clip across the neck of the aneurysm
              while a patient is under general anesthesia. This procedure is
              associated with surgical risks and neurological deficits.
              Endovascular coil embolization, introduced in the 1990s, is the
              health technology under review. LITERATURE REVIEW: METHODS: The
              Medical Advisory Secretariat searched the International Health
              Technology Assessment (INAHTA) Database and the Cochrane Database
              of Systematic Reviews to identify relevant systematic reviews.
              OVID Medline, Medline In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations,
              and Embase were searched for English-language journal articles
              that reported primary data on the effectiveness or
              cost-effectiveness of treatments for intracranial aneurysms,
              obtained in a clinical setting or analyses of primary data
              maintained in registers or institutional databases. Internet
              searches of Medscape and manufacturers' databases were conducted
              to identify product information and recent reports on trials that
              were unpublished but that were presented at international
              conferences. Four systematic reviews, 3 reports on 2 randomized
              controlled trials comparing coil embolization with surgical
              clipping of ruptured aneurysms, 30 observational studies, and 3
              economic analysis reports were included in this review. RESULTS:
              SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS: Coil embolization appears to be a safe
              procedure. Complications associated with coil embolization ranged
              from 8.6\% to 18.6\% with a median of about 10.6\%. Observational
              studies showed that coil embolization is associated with lower
              complication rates than surgical clipping (permanent complication
              3-7\% versus 10.9\%; overall 23\% versus 46\% respectively,
              p=0.009). Common complications of coil embolization are
              thrombo-embolic events (2.5\%-14.5\%), perforation of aneurysm
              (2.3\%-4.7\%), parent artery obstruction (2\%-3\%), collapsed
              coils (8\%), coil malposition (14.6\%), and coil migration
              (0.5\%-3\%). Randomized controlled trials showed that for
              ruptured intracranial aneurysms with SAH, suitable for both coil
              embolization and surgical clipping (mostly saccular aneurysms <10
              mm in diameter located in the anterior circulation) in people
              with good clinical condition:Coil embolization resulted in a
              statistically significant 23.9\% relative risk reduction and 7\%
              absolute risk reduction in the composite rate of death and
              dependency compared to surgical clipping (modified Rankin score
              3-6) at 1-year. The advantage of coil embolization over surgical
              clipping varies widely with aneurysm location, but endovascular
              treatment seems beneficial for all sites. There were less deaths
              in the first 7 years following coil embolization compared to
              surgical clipping (10.8\% vs 13.7\%). This survival benefit
              seemed to be consistent over time, and was statistically
              significant (log-rank p= 0.03). Coil embolization is associated
              with less frequent MRI-detected superficial brain deficits and
              ischemic lesions at 1-year. The 1- year rebleeding rate was 2.4\%
              after coil embolization and 1\% for surgical clipping. Confirmed
              rebleeding from the repaired aneurysm after the first year and up
              to year eight was low and not significantly different between
              coil embolization and surgical clipping (7 patients for coil
              embolization vs 2 patients for surgical clipping, log-rank
              p=0.22). Observational studies showed that patients with SAH and
              good clinical grade had better 6-month outcomes and lower risk of
              symptomatic cerebral vasospasm after coil embolization compared
              to surgical clipping. For unruptured intracranial aneurysms,
              there were no randomized controlled trials that compared coil
              embolization to surgical clipping. Large observational studies
              showed that: The risk of rupture in unruptured aneurysms less
              than 10 mm in diameter is about 0.05\% per year for patients with
              no pervious history of SAH from another aneurysm. The risk of
              rupture increases with history of SAH and as the diameter of the
              aneurysm reaches 10 mm or more. Coil embolization reduced the
              composite rate of in hospital deaths and discharge to long-term
              or short-term care facilities compared to surgical clipping (Odds
              Ratio 2.2, 95\% CI 1.6-3.1, p<0.001). The improvement in
              discharge disposition was highest in people older than 65 years.
              In-hospital mortality rate following treatment of intracranial
              aneurysm ranged from 0.5\% to 1.7\% for coil embolization and
              from 2.1\% to 3.5\% for surgical clipping. The overall 1-year
              mortality rate was 3.1\% for coil embolization and 2.3\% for
              surgical clipping. One-year morbidity rate was 6.4\% for coil
              embolization and 9.8\% for surgical clipping. It is not clear
              whether these differences were statistically significant. Coil
              embolization is associated with shorter hospital stay compared to
              surgical clipping. For both ruptured and unruptured aneurysms,
              the outcome of coil embolization does not appear to be dependent
              on age, whereas surgical clipping has been shown to yield worse
              outcome for patients older than 64 years. ANGIOGRAPHIC EFFICIENCY
              AND RECURRENCES: The main drawback of coil embolization is its
              low angiographic efficiency. The percentage of complete aneurysm
              occlusion after coil embolization (27\%-79\%, median 55\%)
              remains lower than that achieved with surgical clipping
              (82\%-100\%). However, about 90\% of coiled aneurysms achieve
              near total occlusion or better. Incompletely coiled aneurysms
              have been shown to have higher aneurysm recurrence rates ranging
              from 7\% to 39\% for coil embolization compared to 2.9\% for
              surgical clipping. Recurrence is defined as refilling of the
              neck, sac, or dome of a successfully treated aneurysm as shown on
              an angiogram. The long-term clinical significance of incomplete
              occlusion following coil embolization is unknown, but in one case
              series, 20\% of patients had major recurrences, and 50\% of these
              required further treatment. LONG-TERM OUTCOMES: A large
              international randomized trial reported that the survival benefit
              from coil embolization was sustained for at least 7 years. The
              rebleeding rate between year 2 and year 8 following coil
              embolization was low and not significantly different from that of
              surgical clipping. However, high quality long-term angiographic
              evidence is lacking. Accordingly, there is uncertainty about
              long-term occlusion status, coil durability, and recurrence
              rates. While surgical clipping is associated with higher
              immediate procedural risks, its long-term effectiveness has been
              established. INDICATIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS: Coil embolization
              offers treatment for people at increased risk for craniotomy,
              such as those over 65 years of age, with poor clinical status, or
              with comorbid conditions. The technology also makes it possible
              to treat surgical high-risk aneurysms. Not all aneurysms are
              suitable for coil embolization. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)",

              Y-induced feeding",
  author   = "Brown, C M and Coscina, D V",
  abstract = "A variety of recent research has suggested that the feeding
              associated with enhanced neuropeptide Y (NPY) activity within the
              hypothalamus may operate in part by interacting antagonistically
              with other neural processes responsive to serotonin
              (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT). To test this possibility further,
              experiments were performed to determine if the magnitude of
              feeding produced by injecting NPY into the paraventricular
              nucleus (PVN) or the perifornical hypothalamus (PFH) was
              diminished by coinjections of 5-HT into these two sites or
              peripheral injections of the 5-HT agonist, d-fenfluramine. Adult
              male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted unilaterally with
              stainless steel cannulae aimed to terminate either in the PVN or
              the PFH. In both studies, NPY (235 pmol) produced significant
              feeding in both sites either 1 or 2 h after injection when
              compared to saline. This enhanced feeding response was
              significantly greater in the PFH 2 h after injection (40\% in the
              central study; 70\% in the peripheral study). Coinjection of 5-HT
              (6.3, 12.5, or 25.0 nmol) into either site had no effect on the
              induction of this NPY-induced feeding response. However,
              peripherally injected d-fenfluramine (0.32, 0.63, or 1.25 mg/kg)
              produced strong dose-dependent attenuation both 1- and 2-h food
              intake elicited by 235 pmol NPY in either site, with the PFH
              being proportionately more sensitive to this effect. Viewed
              together, these results suggest that the feeding-suppressant
              effects of systemic fenfluramine on hypothalamic NPY-induced
              feeding may operate largely via peripheral mechanisms and/or
              central ones that have little to do with its 5-HT agonistic
              effects within the PVN or PFH.",

              These disorders have not been officially recognized so that they
              are not classified as independent entities. The term orthorexia
              comes from the Greek word orthos (straight, proper) and orexia
              (appetite). It is characterized by the pathological obsession for
              biologically pure food, which leads to important dietary
              restrictions. Orthorexic patients exclude foods from their diets
              that they consider to be impure because they have herbicides,
              pesticides or artificial substances and they worry in excess
              about the techniques and materials used in the food elaboration.
              This obsession leads to loss of social relationships and
              affective dissatisfactions which, in turn, favors obsessive
              concern about food. In orthorexia, that patient initially wants
              to improve his/her health, treat a disease or lose weight.
              Finally, the diet becomes the most important part of their lives.

              the population of Serbia through three dimensions: knowledge,
              problems, and feelings as well as to determine whether there are
              any differences between genders and among different age-groups.
              The research instrument was an Eating Habits Questionnaire (EHQ)
              which consisted of 35 items. There were 382 respondents involved
              in the study. The reliability and factor structure of the
              questionnaire were verified by using factor analysis. The results
              of MANOVA showed that there is a significant difference in the
              habits concerning healthy eating between men and women [F
              (3,378)=4.26, p=0.006; Wilks' Lambda=0.97]. When the results for
              the dependent variables (knowledge, problems, and feelings) were
              considered separately, it was determined that there is no
              significant difference between men and women, which confirms the
              results of the t-test. The effect of age on the three dimensions
              of healthy eating habits was examined within three age-groups, by
              using ANOVA. The results showed that knowledge about healthy
              eating increases with age [F (2,379)=6.14, p=0.002] as well as
              positive feelings which occur as a result of healthy eating [F
              (2,379)=3.66, p=0.027]. Unlike ANOVA, MANOVA showed difference
              among the age-groups only when it came to the 'knowledge'

              of awareness on healthy eating habits in the researched populace

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Although most hospitals have an emergency
              department disaster plan, most never have been implemented in a
              true disaster or been tested objectively. Computer simulation may
              be a useful tool to predict emergency department patient flow
              during a disaster. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare
              the accuracy of a computer simulation in predicting emergency
              department patient flow during a mass-casualty incident with that
              of a real-time, virtual, live exercise. METHODS: History,
              physical examination findings, and laboratory results for 136
              simulated patients were extracted from the disastermed.ca patient
              database as used as input into a computer simulation designed to
              represent the emergency department at the University of Alberta
              Hospital. The computer simulation was developed using a
              commercially available simulation software platform (2005,
              SimProcess, CACI Products, San Diego CA). Patient flow parameters
              were compared to a previous virtual, live exercise using the same
              data set. RESULTS: Although results between the computer
              simulation and the live exercise appear similar, they differ
              statistically with respect to many patient benchmarks. There was
              a marked difference between the triage codes assigned during the
              live exercise and those from the patient database; however, this
              alone did not account for the differences between the patient
              groups. It is likely that novel approaches to patient care
              developed by the live exercise group, which are difficult to
              model by computer software, contributed to differences between
              the groups. Computer simulation was useful, however, in
              predicting how small changes to emergency department structure,
              such as adding staff or patient care areas, can influence patient
              flow. CONCLUSIONS: Computer simulation is helpful in defining the
              effects of changes to a hospital disaster plan. However, it
              cannot fully replace participant exercises. Rather, computer
              simulation and live exercises are complementary, and both may be
              useful for disaster plan evaluation.",

              several observations can be made. First, the incidence of these
              cancers increased after the introduction of screening but has
              never returned to prescreening levels. Second, the increase in
              the relative fraction of early stage cancers has increased.
              Third, the incidence of regional cancers has not decreased at a
              commensurate rate. One possible explanation is that screening may
              be increasing the burden of low-risk cancers without
              significantly reducing the burden of more aggressively growing
              cancers and therefore not resulting in the anticipated reduction

              work presents a new instrument, the Yale-Brown-Cornell Eating
              Disorder Scale (YBC-EDS), that does not limit assessment to a
              particular set of eating-related concerns or behaviors. Rather,
              it assesses the severity of illness associated with an

              this new, clinician-rated instrument was tested in two
              independent samples of DSM-III-R eating disorder patients. The
              YBC-EDS eight-item scale assessing severity of preoccupations and
              rituals, and a set of six provisional items for assessing
              motivation for change were both frequently endorsed and found to

               consuming only biologically pure food that may lead to the
               development of specific ritualistic attitudes towards food
               preparation and the restriction of specific food groups that can
               be harmful to one's health (Zamora et al., 2005; Matera, 2012).
               Aim: Due to the rise in popularity with Instagram and online
               eating disorder communities, and the potential negative outcomes
               on psychosocial health, the purpose of this descriptive study
               was to investigate images tagged with \#orthorexia on Instagram
               over 7 days. Methods: A mixed methods approach was utilized for
               this study. A text analysis was conducted using the Netlytic
               program (Gruzd, 2016) to explore for emerging themes of
               discussion specifically using word count frequency, and a
               network analysis using both a name network (i.e., who mentions
               whom) and a chain network (i.e., who replies to whom) was
               performed. Among a subsample of images, author/image information
               was manually obtained, and a coding scheme (adapted from
               Tiggemann and Zaccardo, 2016) was implemented for a subsample of
               images (results pending). Results: Among the 4,533 records
               downloaded, there were 48,780 unique words associated with the
               posts (in the description of the picture or in the comment
               section). Majority of most commonly used words were associated
               with eating disorder recovery (i.e., 425 instances of
               \#edrecovery; 340 instances of \#recovery; 297 instances of
               \#eatingdisorderrecovery). The chain network/direct interactions
               analysis indicated a large online presence with 1,503 nodes
               (i.e., users) and 1,803 ties (i.e., direct replies between
               users). The coding of \#orthorexia images is pending but will
               help us further understand the orthorexia online community.
               Conclusions: As the network analysis and text analysis suggested
               an eating disorder recovery theme, this suggests that Instagram
               may be being used as a supportive and interactive community for
               those who have/had symptoms of orthorexia.",

              clinical trials of fluoxetine reinforced this agent's more
              favorable adverse-event profile compared with tricyclic
              antidepressants (TCAs). OBJECTIVES: The present meta-analysis
              sought to provide a reanalysis of updated adverse-event and
              discontinuation data for fluoxetine 20 to 80 mg/d compared with
              TCAs and placebo in the treatment of major depressive disorder
              (MDD) in adults. A subanalysis to assess the safety profile of
              the most commonly used effective dose of fluoxetine in MDD (20
              mg) was also conducted. METHODS: Data were obtained from 25
              double-blind clinical trials involving 4016 patients with MDD
              randomized to treatment with fluoxetine 20 to 80 mg/d, TCAs, or
              placebo. The subanalysis included data from 6 trials involving
              1258 patients treated with fixed 20-mg doses of fluoxetine or
              placebo. Spontaneously reported treatment-emergent adverse
              events, reasons for discontinuation, and events leading to
              discontinuation were compared between groups. RESULTS: The age of
              the 4016 randomized patients ranged from 12 to 90 years, with a
              mean age of 46 years. Most patients were white (92\%), and 62\%
              were female. The age of the 1258 patients in the 20-mg fixed-dose
              population ranged from 18 to 90 years, with a mean age of 54
              years; as in the total population, most of these patients were
              white (92\%), and 57\% were female. The adverse-event profiles of
              fluoxetine and TCAs in these trials were consistent with the
              typical profiles of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and
              TCAs. At a dose of 20 mg/d, fluoxetine-treated patients had a
              discontinuation rate due to adverse events that was not
              statistically significantly different from that in placebo
              recipients. Discontinuation rates due to lack of efficacy were
              not significantly different between fluoxetine and TCAs. However,
              significantly more TCA-treated patients discontinued therapy
              because of adverse events and significantly fewer completed
              treatment compared with fluoxetine-treated patients (both, P or =
              2\%) leading to discontinuation were asthenia, dizziness,
              insomnia, nausea, nervousness, somnolence, and tremor in
              fluoxetine-treated patients and abnormal vision, agitation,
              constipation, dizziness, dry mouth, headache, nausea,
              nervousness, rash, somnolence, sweating, and tremor in
              TCA-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Data from this large series of
              clinical trials confirm that fluoxetine is well tolerated in the
              acute treatment of MDD in adults, especially at a dosage of 20
              mg/d, and is better tolerated than the recommended doses of TCAs.",

  author   = "Galloway, R and McGuire, J",
  abstract = "Iron deficiency anemia affects over 2 billion people.
              Particularly at risk are pregnant women and young children.
              Although distribution of iron supplements is practised in many
              antenatal care programs in developing countries, it has often
              been alleged that pregnant women do not take them. Poor
              compliance arises not only because of patient behavior but also
              from factors out of the patient's control. This paper presents
              the results of a review of the literature on medical compliance
              to determine whether iron supplementation is different from other
              medications, to assess the known levels of compliance, and to
              synthesize recommendations for improving compliance relevant to
              iron supplementation. The review showed that compliance with iron
              therapy is a specific case of medical compliance. Reasons for
              non-compliance with iron deficiency treatment include: inadequate
              program support (lack of political commitment and financial
              support); insufficient service delivery (poor provider-user
              dynamics; lack of supplies, access, training, and motivation of
              health care professionals); and patient factors (misunderstanding
              instructions, side effects, frustration about the frequency and
              number of pills taken, migration, fear of having big babies,
              personal problems, nausea that accompanies pregnancy, and the
              subtlety of anemia which makes demand for treatment low). Much
              has been made about the side effects (nausea, constipation, etc.)
              that women might experience during iron therapy as the cause of
              poor compliance with iron supplementation without justification
              according to this review. Instead, unavailability of iron
              supplements was the most common reason why women did not take
              iron supplements. Women bear a disproportionate burden from iron
              deficiency anemia even though the technology exists to address
              the problem at low cost. Governments and health care
              professionals must renew their commitment to iron therapy by
              monitoring and improving compliance. We can significantly improve
              compliance by: making sure that iron supplements are available at
              all times; providing advanced warning about the possibility of
              side effects; involving the patient in the therapeutic strategy;
              and providing reminders, such as posters and calendars, about
              taking supplements.",

               nervosa--an obsession with eating healthfully--and offer expert
               advice on how to treat it. As Americans become better informed
               about health, more and more people have turned to diet as a way
               to lose weight and keep themselves in peak condition. Anorexia
               nervosa and bulimia nervosa--disorders in which the sufferer
               focuses on the quantity of food eaten--have been highly
               documented over the past decade. But as Dr. Steven Bratman
               asserts in this breakthrough book, for many people, eating
               ``correctly'' has become an equally harmful obsession, one that
               causes them to adopt progressively more rigid diets that not
               only eliminate crucial nutrients and food groups, but ultimately
               cost them their overall health, personal relationships, and
               emotional well-being. Health Food Junkies is the first book to
               identify this new eating disorder, orthorexia nervosa, and to
               offer detailed, practical advice on how to cope with and
               overcome it. Orthorexia nervosa occurs when the victim becomes
               obsessed, not with the quantity of food eaten, but the quality
               of the food. What starts as a devotion to healthy eating can
               evolve into a pattern of incredibly strict diets; victims become
               so focused on eating a ``pure'' diet (usually raw vegetables and
               grains) that the planning and preparation of food come to play
               the dominant role in their lives. Health Food Junkies provides
               an expert analysis of some of today's most popular diets--from
               The Zone to macrobiotics, raw-foodism to food allergy
               elimination--and shows not only how they can lead to orthorexia,
               but how they are often built on faulty logic rather than sound
               medical advice. Offering expert insight gleaned from his work
               with orthorexia patients, Dr. Bratman outlines the symptoms of
               orthorexia, describes its progression, and shows readers how to
               diagnose the condition. Finally, Dr. Bratman offers practical
               suggestions for intervention and treatment, giving readers the
               tools they need to conquer this painful disorder, rediscover the

              for a total of 94 artists with mean age of 33 years. The ORTO-15
              test was used to determine the prevalence of orthorexia nervosa.
              Those subjects who scored below 40 in the ORTO-15 test were
              classified as having orthorexia nervosa. Mean score of the
              participants in the ORTO-15 test was 37.9+/-4.46. A total of
              56.4\% of the artists involved in the research scored below 40 in
              the ORTO-15 test. While the highest prevalence of orthorexia
              nervosa was recorded among opera singers (81.8\%), it was 32.1\%
              among ballet dancers and 36.4\% among symphony orchestra
              musicians. The differences between the three groups were
              statistically significant. No difference was noted between mean
              ORTO-15 score by baseline characteristics as gender, age,
              educational level, work experience, body mass index, smoking and
              alcohol consumption. The research group have a higher
              socio-economic and education level than the majority of the
              general public in Turkey. Additionally, being an artist in Turkey
              means being a role model for the general public both in terms
              one's physical appearance and lifestyle. These may be the reason
              why artists are more sensitive to this issue.",

              primary care physicians with that provided by 2 hospitalist
              models: critical care hospitalists and rotating residency faculty
              family physician hospitalists. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart
              review. A health maintenance organization mandated that all
              patients be admitted to a critical care hospitalist team. The
              family physician hospitalists admitted all other residency
              patients and patients of some community family physicians. The
              primary care physicians admitted all their other patients. We
              adjusted for disease severity by using the Pneumonia Severity
              Index, age, sex, and comorbidities. POPULATION: Adults admitted
              with pneumonia to our private urban community hospital.
              Exclusions included patients with nosocomial pneumonia, human
              immunodeficiency virus, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
              OUTCOMES MEASURED: Primary (adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities,
              and disease severity): hospital charges, length of stay,
              in-hospital mortality, readmissions, and returns to the emergency
              room. Secondary: chest radiographs, intensive care use, blood and
              sputum cultures, compliance with American Thoracic Society
              guidelines, lifestyle and end-of-life counseling. RESULTS: Of 97
              patients, 21 were admitted to the critical care hospitalists, 53
              to the family physician hospitalists, and 23 to primary care
              physicians. The mean charge (\$5680) by the primary care
              physicians was significantly lower than that of the critical care
              hospitalists (\$10,231; P=.005) and trended toward being lower
              than that of the family physician hospitalists (\$7699; P=.08).
              The patients of critical care and family physician hospitalists
              had longer mean lengths of stay (critical care hospitalists, 3.8
              days; family physician hospitalists, 3.9 days) than did those of
              the primary care physicians (2.6 days; P=.04 and.01,
              respectively). Compared with the primary care physicians, the
              critical care hospitalists were more likely to obtain at least 2
              chest x-rays (odds ratio, 4.1; 95\% confidence interval,
              1.1-15.5) and trended toward increased odds of lengthy stay in
              the intensive care unit (odd ratio, 2.9; 95\% confidence
              interval, 0.6-14.6). We found no other significant differences in
              primary or secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Claims of better and
              cheaper care by hospitalists need further investigation.
              Meanwhile, the use of hospitalists should not be mandated, and
              the use of family physicians as hospitalists should be considered
              a good alternative to the use of subspecialists.",

              technology holds great potential and has been demonstrated to
              have better clinical outcomes compared with traditional
              techniques. However, it has not been compared with other assisted
              tools for the treatment of lumbar degenerative disease. This
              article focused on studying such variances. MATERIAL AND METHODS
              A total of 176 pedicle screws were inserted in 39 patients using
              a spine robot (group 1), 134 screws were implanted in 28 patients
              using navigational template (group 2), 234 screws were implanted
              in 51 patients by O-arm-based navigation (group 3), and 346
              screws were implanted in 72 patients by fluoroscopy-guided
              assistance (group 4). The screw position was evaluated using
              postoperative scans according to Rampersaud A to D
              classification, and other secondary data were also collected.
              RESULTS ``Perfect'' pedicle screw insertion (Grade A) was
              90.34\%, 91.79\%, 84.19\%, and 65.03\% of groups 1-4,
              respectively. ``Clinically acceptable'' screw implantation (Grade
              A+B) was 94.32\%, 95.52, 90.60\%, and 78.03\% in groups 1-4,
              respectively. Deviation sagittal (°) respectively was 3$\pm$9,
              2$\pm$10, 4$\pm$7, and 10$\pm$8° in groups 1-4, respectively.
              Deviation transversal (°) screw insertion was 3$\pm$8, 3$\pm$7,
              4$\pm$9, and 8$\pm$13° in groups 1-4, respectively. Statistical
              analysis showed group 1 had no significant difference in the

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Managing patients' requests for appointments is an
              important general practice activity. No previous research has
              systematically observed how patients and receptionists negotiate
              appointments. AIM: To observe appointment making and investigate
              patients' and professionals' experiences of appointment
              negotiations. DESIGN OF STUDY: A qualitative study using
              participant observation. SETTING: Three general practices on
              Tyneside; a single-handed practice, a practice comprising three
              doctors, and a seven-doctor practice. METHOD: Participant
              observation sessions, consisting of 35 activity recordings and 34
              periods of observation and 38 patient and 15 professional
              interviews, were set up. Seven groups of patients were selected
              for interview. These included patients attending an 'open access'
              surgery, patients who complained about making an appointment, and
              patients who complimented the receptionists. RESULTS: Appointment
              making is a complex social process. Outcomes are dependent on the
              process of negotiation and factors, such as patients'
              expectations and appointment availability. Receptionists felt
              that patients in employment, patients allocated to the practice
              by the Health Authority, and patients who did not comply with
              practice appointment rules were most demanding. Appointment
              requests are legitimised by receptionists enforcing practice
              rules and requesting clinical information. Patients volunteer
              information to provide evidence that their complaint is
              appropriate and employ strategies, such as persistence,
              assertiveness, and threats, to try and persuade receptionists to
              grant appointments. CONCLUSION: Appointment making is a complex
              social process where outcomes are negotiated. Receptionists have
              an important role in managing patient demand. Practices should be
              explicit about how appointments are allocated, including
              publishing practice criteria.",

              as ``a maniacal obsession for healthy foods''. MATERIALS AND
              METHODS: 404 subjects were enrolled. Diagnosis of ON was based on
              both the presence of a disorder with obsessive-compulsive
              personality features and an exaggerated healthy eating behaviour
              pattern. RESULTS: Of the 404 subjects examined, 28 were found to
              suffer from ON (prevalence of 6.9\%). The analysis of the
              physiological characteristics, the social-cultural and the
              psychological behaviour that characterises subjects suffering
              from ON shows a higher prevalence in men and in those with a
              lower level of education. The orthorexic subjects attribute
              characteristics that show their specific ``feelings'' towards
              food (``dangerous'' to describe a conserved product,

  abstract = "Background: The Joint Commission's accreditation standard on
              managing patient flow, effective January 2005, served as a call
              to action for hospitals, yet many hospitals still lack the
              processes and structures to admit or transfer patients to an
              inpatient bed on a timely basis. In 2007 the University of
              Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) at Shadyside, a 526-bed tertiary
              care hospital, began testing and implementing real-time demand
              capacity management (RTDC) at an initial pilot site. The hospital
              had identified improved patient flow as a strategic goal in 2002,
              but a series of patient flow projects failed to result in
              improvement.Implementing RTDC: Standard processes for the four
              RTDC steps---Predicting Capacity, Predicting Demand, Developing a
              Plan, and Evaluating a Plan---and standard structures for unit
              bed huddles and the hospital bed meetings were developed. The
              neurosurgery (NS) service line's ICU and stepdown unit were
              designated as the first pilot sites, but work was quickly spread
              to other units.Results: Improvements were achieved and have been
              sustained through early 2011 for all measures, including (1) the
              unit-based reliability of discharge predictions; (2) overnight
              holds in the postanesthesia care unit, a problem eliminated two
              months after RTDC work began; (3) the percentage of patients who
              left without being seen (LWBS), routinely < 0.5\% by May 2008;
              (5) the emergency department median length of stay for admitted
              patients, routinely < 4 hours after March 2008; and (6) aggregate
              length of stay (ALOS), generally maintained at < 5.75
              days.Conclusions: RTDC represents a promising approach to
              improving hospitalwide patient flow. Its four steps, integrated
              into current bed management processes, are not an add-on to the
              work needing to be accomplished everyday.",

              many ways, we have been reinventing the wheel during the last 25
              years. Historically, simulators have been much more than simple
              models, and we can still learn from aspects of simulation used
              hundreds of years ago. This book gives a narrative history of the
              development of simulators from the early 1700s to the middle of
              the 20th century when simulation in healthcare appeared to all
              but die out. It is organized around the development of simulation
              in different countries and includes at the end a guide to
              simulators in museums and private collections throughout the
              world. The aim is to increase understanding of simulation in the
              professional education of healthcare providers by exploring the
              historical context of simulators that were developed in the past,
              what they looked like, how they were used, and examples of
              simulator use that led to significant harm and an erosion of
              standards. The book is addressed to the healthcare simulation
              community and historians of medicine. The latter in particular
              will appreciate the identification and use of historic sources

              Descriptive survey. SETTING: Sixty-four acute care hospitals in
              the northeastern United States. SAMPLE: Responders represented 93
              critical care units: 59 adult and 34 pediatric units.
              MEASUREMENTS: Subjects completed a survey questionnaire. RESULTS:
              Forty-one percent reported cuffs were routinely deflated, with
              most (88\%) reporting cuff deflation every 8 to 12 hours or
              daily. In the pediatric population, minimal occlusive volume was
              the most frequent technique (29\%); whereas in the adult
              population, both minimal occlusive volume technique and minimal
              leak technique were used more frequently (36\%). Most (93\%) cuff
              pressures were measured every 8 to 12 hours or daily with a
              recommended maximum range of 20 to 30 mm Hg. Cuff deflation and
              cuff inflation were performed more often by the nursing staff

              staff (71\%). There were no statistically significant differences
              in the cuff management practices between the adult and pediatric
              populations. In comparing the results for adults to the data of
              1984 and 1987, most cuff management practices changed from every
              8 hours or less to every 8 to 12 hours or daily, and the nursing
              responsibility for these techniques increased (22\%). CONCLUSION:
              Most responders do not routinely deflate cuffs. Cuff management
              practices are performed less frequently, and nursing
              responsibility for these techniques has increased.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening
              syndrome that is precipitated by the use of serotonergic drugs
              and overactivation of both the peripheral and central
              postsynaptic 5HT-1A and, most notably, 5HT-2A receptors. This
              syndrome consists of a combination of mental status changes,
              neuromuscular hyperactivity, and autonomic hyperactivity.
              Serotonin syndrome can occur via the therapeutic use of
              serotonergic drugs alone, an intentional overdose of serotonergic
              drugs, or classically, as a result of a complex drug interaction
              between two serotonergic drugs that work by different mechanisms.
              A multitude of drug combinations can result in serotonin
              syndrome. METHODS: This review describes the presentation and
              management of serotonin syndrome and discusses the drugs and
              interactions that can precipitate this syndrome with the goal of
              making physicians more alert and aware of this potentially fatal
              yet preventable syndrome. CONCLUSION: Many commonly used
              medications have proven to be the culprits of serotonin syndrome.
              Proper education and awareness about serotonin syndrome will
              improve the accuracy of diagnosis and promote the institution of
              the appropriate treatment that may prevent significant morbidity

              capsule formulation of Adderall designed to produce a therapeutic
              effect that lasts throughout the day with 1 morning dose. The
              primary objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and
              safety of SLI381 compared with placebo in the treatment of
              attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children in a

              to assess the diurnal variation in responses based on morning and
              afternoon assessments. METHODS: A multicenter, randomized,
              double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial was
              conducted at 47 sites. After a 1-week washout of any previous

              single-daily morning doses of placebo or SLI381 10 mg, 20 mg, or

              Fourth Edition criteria diagnosis of ADHD were included. The
              primary efficacy parameter was the Conners Global Index Scale for
              Teachers. Secondary efficacy parameters included the Conners
              Global Index Scale for Parents, the Clinical Global Impressions
              Scale for improvement, and the Parent Global Assessment for
              improvement. Safety was assessed by recording adverse events,
              laboratory tests, and vital signs at each visit during the study.
              Physical examinations and electrocardiograms were performed at
              the screening and the end of the study. RESULTS: Five hundred
              eighty-four children were randomized, 563 were included in the
              intent-to-treat population, and 509 completed the entire study.
              Intention-to-treat analysis of Conners Global Index Scale for
              Teachers and Conners Global Index Scale for Parents scores
              revealed significant improvement in morning, afternoon, and late
              afternoon behavior for all active treatment groups versus
              placebo. All active treatment groups showed significant
              dose-related improvement in behavior from baseline. Both the
              Clinical Global Impressions Scale for improvement and Parent
              Global Assessment for improvement showed all doses of SLI381 to
              be superior to placebo at treatment end and both confirmed the
              dose-response relationship between improvement and the SLI381
              dose. The incidence of spontaneously reported adverse events was
              low and similar for active treatments and placebo. CONCLUSIONS:
              SLI381 produced consistent, dose-related improvements on all
              measures of efficacy. The extended-release nature of the SLI381
              formulation was shown by continued, significant improvement in
              afternoon assessments by teachers and afternoon and late
              afternoon assessments by parents. The time course and therapeutic
              effects of SLI381 suggests that this medication is an efficacious
              once-daily treatment for children with ADHD.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Research is needed to clarify and improve our
              understanding of appropriateness and safety issues concerning
              antidepressant (AD) treatment. We explored the long-term trend in
              the dispensing of pediatric ADs using provincial,
              population-based data from Canada. METHODS: Data covering 22 ADs
              were drawn from the Saskatchewan Ministry of Health
              administrative data files in outpatient settings. The data were
              for 9 triennial years from 1983 to 2007, a 24-year period, for
              those aged 0 to 19 in the general population. Descriptive
              analyses were used. RESULTS: In 1983, 5.9 per 1000 population
              aged 0 to 19 were dispensed at least 1 AD; this decreased to 5.1
              per 1000 population in 1989, and then increased to 15.4 per 1000
              population in 2007, with a slower increase after 2004. Both sexes
              were dispensed more ADs from 1989 onwards, with females being the
              heavier users. The rate of AD use increased significantly with
              age, and this trend became more pronounced after 1998. Family
              physicians were the major prescribers and their prescriptions
              significantly increased from 1989 to 2004 and decreased in 2007.
              The use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) was
              the major reason for the increase. The number of AD scripts per
              patient also increased. CONCLUSIONS: The growth in the prevalence
              of AD use among children and youth was largely caused by the use
              of SSRIs. The possibility of safety issues induced by AD use
              among children and adolescents, and different patterns of
              medication practice, suggest continuing education is warranted.",

              (IVS7), and the 353Arg-Gln polymorphism. All the polymorphisms,
              which showed strong allelic association, analyzed separately or
              in combination by the one-way analysis of variance, were
              associated with significantly different FVII levels. The 5'F7 and
              353Arg-Gln polymorphic systems, which have very similar allele
              frequencies, contributed to a similar extent to the total
              phenotypic variance, whereas the contribution of the IVS7
              polymorphism was lower. Genetic variation at the FVII locus,
              evaluated on combined genotypes, accounted for up to 40\% of the
              phenotype FVII variance. As also shown by the two-way analysis of
              variance, the use of two out of three markers is advisable, and
              since the 5'F7 polymorphism can be screened by a simple
              immunoassay, it should be preferred for population-based studies.
              No substantial differences between FVII activity and FVII antigen
              levels were found, thus suggesting that the variation was due to
              biosynthesis- or stability-mediated mechanisms. The genetic
              control of FVII levels described in this study plays an important
              role in determining plasma FVII level variability, which may

              intake, may interact to control energy homoeostasis. We therefore
              investigated the effects of fluoxetine, which inhibits serotonin
              reuptake, on food intake and the activity of the neuropeptide
              Yergic arcuato-paraventricular projection in lean Wistar and

              which obesity is postulated to be due to overactivity of the
              arcuato-paraventricular projection. Fluoxetine significantly
              reduced food intake in lean and obese rats, both during
              continuous subcutaneous infusion and (10 mg/kg/day for seven
              days) and acutely after a single injection (10 mg/kg). Fluoxetine
              also significantly reduced neuropeptide Y levels in the
              paraventricular nucleus, a major site of neuropeptide Y release
              which is highly sensitive to the appetite-stimulating actions of
              neuropeptide Y. Push-pull sampling in lean and fatty Zucker rats
              showed that neuropeptide Y secretion in the paraventricular
              nucleus was significantly reduced after acute fluoxetine
              treatment. Furthermore, seven days fluoxetine treatment prevented
              the significant increases in hypothalamic neuropeptide Y
              messenger RNA which were induced in lean rats by food restriction
              which precisely matched the hypophagia induced by the drug. We
              conclude that fluoxetine inhibits various aspects of the activity
              of the neuropeptide Yergic arcuato-paraventricular neurons, and
              suggest that reduced neuropeptide Y release in the
              paraventricular nucleus may mediate, at least in part, the drug's
              hypophagic action. We further suggest that serotonin may
              influence food intake and energy balance by inhibiting the
              arcuato-paraventricular projection, and that the two
              neurotransmitters may act together to regulate feeding and energy
              homoeostasis.",

  author    = "Lee, L M and Henderson, D K",
  abstract  = "A substantial body of evidence provides support (but not
               definitive proof of efficacy) for the use of antiretroviral
               agents as postexposure prophylaxis for occupational exposures to
               HIV in the healthcare workplace. Despite the lack of definitive
               evidence of the efficacy of these agents in this setting, over
               the past decade this intervention has become the standard of
               care for healthcare workers who sustain occupational exposures
               to HIV. Administration of these agents--even for a relatively
               short 28-day postexposure course--is often fraught with
               difficulty. All of the agents currently used for postexposure
               prophylaxis regimens have substantial adverse effects, and
               significant adverse effects occur in more than two-thirds of
               individuals electing prophylaxis. This manuscript reiterates
               current US Federal Government guidelines for the administration
               of postexposure prophylaxis, specifically noting that zidovudine
               plus lamivudine (with or without a protease inhibitor) remains
               the recommended regimen. The paper summarises the significant
               toxicities associated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase
               inhibitors (primarily nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and bone
               marrow suppression), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase
               inhibitors (rash, fever, gastrointestinal symptoms and
               hepatitis, including hepatic decompensation necessitating liver
               transplantation) and protease inhibitors (nausea, vomiting,
               diarrhoea, abdominal pain, hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia,
               headache and anorexia). As a class, the antiretroviral agents
               have an extraordinary number of drug interactions. The
               non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and the protease
               inhibitors are metabolised through the cytochrome P450 pathway,
               and the effects of concomitant administration of protease
               inhibitors with other agents in the same class are discussed, as
               well as the effects of concomitant administration of protease
               inhibitors with non-nucleoside agents. The potential for
               numerous and medically risky drug interactions emphasises the
               importance of planning antiretroviral prophylaxis in
               consultation with practitioners or clinical pharmacists who are
               skilled in the use of these agents and knowledgeable about the
               potential for significant drug interactions that could either
               reduce the benefit of prophylaxis or increase the potential for
               toxicity. Another common problem encountered by individuals
               managing postexposure prophylaxis programmes relates to the
               administration of chemoprophylaxis to a pregnant healthcare
               worker who has sustained an occupational exposure to HIV. We
               address what is known about the potential for toxicity and
               emphasise the recently published warning concerning the deaths
               of pregnant women and their offspring from lactic acidosis while

               were different for men and women, and for older and younger

              that low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening reduces lung
              cancer mortality in a high-risk U.S. population. A
              microsimulation model of LDCT screening was developed to estimate
              the impact of introducing population-based screening in Canada.
              DATA AND METHODS: LDCT screening was simulated using the lung
              cancer module of the Cancer Risk Management Model (CRMM-LC),
              which generates large, representative samples of the Canadian
              population from which a cohort with characteristics similar to
              NLST participants was selected. Screening parameters were
              estimated for stage shift, LDCT sensitivity and specificity, lead
              time, and survival to fit to NLST incidence and mortality
              results. The estimation process was a step-wise directed search.
              RESULTS: Simulated mortality reduction from LDCT screening was
              23\% in the CRMM-LC, compared with 20\% in the NLST. The
              difference in the number of lung cancer cases over six years
              varied by, at most, 2.3\% in the screen arm. The difference in
              cumulative incidence at six years was less than 2\% in both
              screen and control arms. The estimated percentage over-diagnosed
              was 24.8\%, which was 6\% higher than NLST results.
              INTERPRETATION: Simulated screening reproduces NLST results. The
              CRMM-LC can evaluate a variety of population-based screening
              strategies. Sensitivity analyses are recommended to provide a
              range of projections to reflect model uncertainty.",

                  destroy undesirable tissue. From as early as 3500 BC, there
                  is evidence for the use of cold in medicine for the treatment
                  of infected wounds of the chest, fracture of the skull and
                  various injuries. However, the history of ``modern''
                  cryosurgery is relatively short and is closely intertwined
                  with the development in low temperature physics, engineering,
                  and instrumentation during the last century. From the early
                  21st century, advanced helium-based cryosurgery has been
                  applied worldwide. More than ten thousand patients with
                  malignant and benign tumors have received cryosurgery. It is
                  specially noted that in most cases cryosurgery, as a
                  mini-invasive ablation technique, was performed with
                  percutaneous approach under guidance of CT or ultrasound.
                  Cryosurgery is now one of the more popular techniques in
                  China, with nearly 6000 cases of tumors receiving cryosurgery
                  in the author's institution alone. This book summarizes the
                  experimental and clinical experience and practice of
                  cryosurgery, and describes the basics of cryosurgery and its
