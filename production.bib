  abstract = "Poly(A) tail elongation after export of an messenger RNA (mRNA)
              to the cytoplasm is called cytoplasmic polyadenylation. It was
              first discovered in oocytes and embryos, where it has roles in
              meiosis and development. In recent years, however, has been
              implicated in many other processes, including synaptic plasticity
              and mitosis. This review aims to introduce cytoplasmic
              polyadenylation with an emphasis on the factors and elements
              mediating this process for different mRNAs and in different
              animal species. We will discuss the RNA sequence elements
              mediating cytoplasmic polyadenylation in the 3' untranslated
              regions of mRNAs, including the CPE, MBE, TCS, eCPE, and C-CPE.
              In addition to describing the role of general polyadenylation
              factors, we discuss the specific RNA binding protein families
              associated with cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements, including
              CPEB (CPEB1, CPEB2, CPEB3, and CPEB4), Pumilio (PUM2), Musashi
              (MSI1, MSI2), zygote arrest (ZAR2), ELAV like proteins (ELAVL1,
              HuR), poly(C) binding proteins (PCBP2, $\alpha$CP2, hnRNP-E2),
              and Bicaudal C (BICC1). Some emerging themes in cytoplasmic
              polyadenylation will be highlighted. To facilitate understanding

              of culture post-irradiation. Sham-irradiated cells showed no
              $\gamma$H2AX foci and therefore no signs of radiation-induced
              double-strand DNA breaks. Flow cytometry indicated that 41.5\% of
              HepG2 cells were in G2/M and this rose statistically
              significantly with increasing radiation dose reaching a plateau
              at ∼47\%. Cell lysates from both cell lines were subjected to
              metabolomic analysis using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry
              (GCMS). A total of 46 metabolites could be identified by GCMS in
              HepG2 cell lysates and 29 in HMCL-7304 lysates, most of which
              occurred in HepG2 cells. Principal Components Analysis (PCA)
              showed a clear separation of sham, 1, 2 and 4 Gy doses.
              Orthogonal Projection to Latent Structures-Discriminant Analysis

              significantly elevated at both 2 and 4 Gy compared with sham

              cytosolic aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect), with potential
              shunting of glucose through aldose reductase in the polyol
              pathway, and consumption of reduced Glutathione (GSH) due to
              $\gamma$-irradiation. In HMCL-7304 myotubes, a putative Warburg
              effect was also observed only at 2 Gy, albeit a lesser magnitude
              than in HepG2 cells. It is anticipated that these novel metabolic

              mRNA polyadenylation isoform choice. 3' untranslated regions
              regulate mRNA fate, and their choice is tightly controlled during

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Spastic cerebral palsy (CP) is a leading cause of
              physical disability. Most people with spastic CP are born with
              it, but early diagnosis is challenging, and no current biomarker
              platform readily identifies affected individuals. The aim of this
              study was to evaluate epigenetic profiles as biomarkers for
              spastic CP. A novel analysis pipeline was employed to assess DNA
              methylation patterns between peripheral blood cells of adolescent
              subjects (14.9 $\pm$ 0.3 years old) with spastic CP and controls
              at single CpG site resolution. RESULTS: Significantly hypo- and
              hyper-methylated CpG sites associated with spastic CP were
              identified. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling fully
              discriminated the CP group from the controls. Machine learning
              based classification modeling indicated a high potential for a
              diagnostic model, and 252 sets of 40 or fewer CpG sites achieved
              near-perfect accuracy within our adolescent cohorts. A pilot test
              on significantly younger subjects (4.0 $\pm$ 1.5 years old)
              identified subjects with 73\% accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent
              patients with spastic CP can be distinguished from a non-CP
              cohort based on DNA methylation patterns in peripheral blood
              cells. A clinical diagnostic test utilizing a panel of CpG sites
              may be possible using a simulated classification model. A pilot
              validation test on patients that were more than 10 years younger
              than the main adolescent cohorts indicated that distinguishing
              methylation patterns are present earlier in life. This study is
              the first to report an epigenetic assay capable of distinguishing

  abstract = "Switching between different alternative polyadenylation (APA)
              sites plays an important role in the fine tuning of gene
              expression. New technologies for the execution of 3'-end enriched
              RNA-seq allow genome-wide detection of the genes that exhibit
              significant APA site switching between different samples. Here,
              we show that the independence test gives better results than the
              linear trend test in detecting APA site-switching events. Further
              examination suggests that the discrepancy between these two
              statistical methods arises from complex APA site-switching events
              that cannot be represented by a simple change of average 3'-UTR
              length. In theory, the linear trend test is only effective in
              detecting these simple changes. We classify the switching events
              into four switching patterns: two simple patterns (3'-UTR
              shortening and lengthening) and two complex patterns. By
              comparing the results of the two statistical methods, we show
              that complex patterns account for 1/4 of all observed switching
              events that happen between normal and cancerous human breast cell
              lines. Because simple and complex switching patterns may convey
              different biological meanings, they merit separate study. We
              therefore propose to combine both the independence test and the
              linear trend test in practice. First, the independence test
              should be used to detect APA site switching; second, the linear
              trend test should be invoked to identify simple switching events;
              and third, those complex switching events that pass independence
              testing but fail linear trend testing can be identified.",

              endonucleolytic cleavage, followed by the addition of a poly(A)
              tail. Through alternative polyadenylation, a gene can give rise
              to multiple mRNA isoforms that differ in the length of their 3'
              UTRs and hence in their susceptibility to post-transcriptional
              regulatory factors such as microRNAs. A series of recently
              conducted high-throughput studies of poly(A) site usage revealed

  abstract  = "ABSTRACTAn increased interest in health, diet, and physical
               activity exist among young people, in this study termed ?fitness
               hype?. Viewing the body and health as commodities can be
               understood as part of a healthism discourse. In this study, we
               explored how Swedish high school students perceive and negotiate
               the trend regarding exercise, diet and body ideals.
               Semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten high school
               students, aged 16?18 years, from various educational programs
               and with varying levels of physical activity. Using qualitative
               content analysis, we developd one overarching theme navigating
               life satisfaction in the face of an ?unhealthy fitness hype?.
               Four additional, interrelated categories showed how the young
               people negotiated this developing trend through: (1) the quest
               for social recognition and value, (2) social media sets the
               standards, (3) the paradox of strong and skinny as the new
               standard, and (4) the need for new safety nets. Our results
               highlight the young people?s perceptions of an excessive and
               influential focus on health and exercise in contemporary
               society. They described a fitness hype as exorbitant and
               unhealthy ideals of body and exercise, and understood this as
               problematic. Social media was seen as contributing to this hype
               as a powerful arena for ?the quest for social recognition and
               value?. While not all the young people felt negatively affected
               by the fitness hype, they perceived its influence on their
               lives. Further, body and fitness ideals were gendered. Teenage
               girls faced the paradox of shaping themselves as ?strong and
               skinny?. Social ties were recognized as an important safety net,
               particularly classmates, sports mates, and coaches. Knowledge of
               these problems from the perspective of young people is crucially
               needed among health professionals and educators. Further
               research should explore additional support strategies, and young
               people?s experiences of fitness hype among additional youth

              healthy eating to avoid ill health. In the Swedish context, ON is
              also understood in terms of unhealthy exercise. Fitness gyms are
              popular health-promoting places, but exercise-related problems,
              disordered eating and ON-like behaviour are increasing. Personal
              trainers (PTs) play an important role in detecting unhealthy
              behaviours. The aim of the present study was to illuminate PTs'
              understandings of healthy and unhealthy exercise and eating
              behaviours in relation to orthorexia nervosa in a fitness gym
              context. Five focus groups with 14 PTs were conducted. These were
              analysed using interpretative qualitative content analysis and
              Becker's model ``Kinds of Deviance.'' In contrast to PTs' health
              norms (practicing balanced behaviours and contributing to
              well-being), ON was expressed mainly in terms of exercise
              behaviour and as being excessive and in total control. The PTs
              maintain that extreme behaviours are legitimized by an aggressive
              exercise trend in society and that they fear to falsely accuse
              clients of being pathological. Certain sport contexts

              requirements for the Business Support System (BSS) in
              telecommunications networks. It is crucial and essential for
              service providers to maintain good operating state of the BSS. In
              this paper, we aim at system error prediction for a BSS, i.e., we
              predict occurrences of the abnormal state or behavior of the BSS.
              Because the occurrences of system errors are rare events in the
              BSS (i.e., the dataset of system status is highly imbalanced), it
              is highly challenging to use machine learning or deep learning
              algorithms to predict system error for the BSS. To address this
              challenge, we propose a machine learning based framework for the
              system error prediction and a Frequency-based Feature Creation
              (FFC) algorithm to create new features to improve prediction. By
              adding the time-series information created by the existing
              features, the proposed FFC can amplify the effects of important
              features. Our experimental results show that the FFC

              10,000 regions of overlapping synonymous constraint within

              pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), important
              lessons can be drawn from the study of the full transmission
              dynamics of its causative agent-severe acute respiratory syndrome
              coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)- in Wuhan (China), where vigorous
              non-pharmaceutical interventions have suppressed the local
              outbreak of this disease1. Here we use a modelling approach to
              reconstruct the full-spectrum dynamics of COVID-19 in Wuhan
              between 1 January and 8 March 2020 across 5 periods defined by
              events and interventions, on the basis of 32,583
              laboratory-confirmed cases1. Accounting for presymptomatic
              infectiousness2, time-varying ascertainment rates, transmission
              rates and population movements3, we identify two key features of
              the outbreak: high covertness and high transmissibility. We
              estimate 87\% (lower bound, 53\%) of the infections before 8
              March 2020 were unascertained (potentially including asymptomatic
              and mildly symptomatic individuals); and a basic reproduction
              number (R0) of 3.54 (95\% credible interval 3.40-3.67) in the
              early outbreak, much higher than that of severe acute respiratory
              syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)4,5.
              We observe that multipronged interventions had considerable
              positive effects on controlling the outbreak, decreasing the
              reproduction number to 0.28 (95\% credible interval 0.23-0.33)
              and-by projection-reducing the total infections in Wuhan by
              96.0\% as of 8 March 2020. We also explore the probability of
              resurgence following the lifting of all interventions after 14
              consecutive days of no ascertained infections; we estimate this
              probability at 0.32 and 0.06 on the basis of models with 87\% and
              53\% unascertained cases, respectively-highlighting the risk
              posed by substantial covert infections under changing control
              measures. These results have important implications when
              considering strategies of continuing surveillance and
              interventions to eventually contain outbreaks of COVID-19.",

  abstract  = "RNA has a dual role as an informational molecule and a direct
               effector of biological tasks. The latter function is enabled by
               RNA's ability to adopt complex secondary and tertiary folds and
               thus has motivated extensive computational and experimental
               efforts for determining RNA structures. Existing approaches for
               evaluating RNA structure have been largely limited to in vitro
               systems, yet the thermodynamic forces which drive RNA folding in
               vitro may not be sufficient to predict stable RNA structures in
               vivo. Indeed, the presence of RNA-binding proteins and
               ATP-dependent helicases can influence which structures are
               present inside cells. Here we present an approach for globally
               monitoring RNA structure in native conditions in vivo with
               single-nucleotide precision. This method is based on in vivo
               modification with dimethyl sulphate (DMS), which reacts with
               unpaired adenine and cytosine residues, followed by deep
               sequencing to monitor modifications. Our data from yeast and
               mammalian cells are in excellent agreement with known messenger
               RNA structures and with the high-resolution crystal structure of
               the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosome. Comparison between in
               vivo and in vitro data reveals that in rapidly dividing cells
               there are vastly fewer structured mRNA regions in vivo than in
               vitro. Even thermostable RNA structures are often denatured in
               cells, highlighting the importance of cellular processes in
               regulating RNA structure. Indeed, analysis of mRNA structure
               under ATP-depleted conditions in yeast shows that
               energy-dependent processes strongly contribute to the
               predominantly unfolded state of mRNAs inside cells. Our studies
               broadly enable the functional analysis of physiological RNA
               structures and reveal that, in contrast to the Anfinsen view of
               protein folding whereby the structure formed is the most
               thermodynamically favourable, thermodynamics have an incomplete
               role in determining mRNA structure in vivo.",

              In the current study, 8 cases of carcinoma showing thymus-like
              elements were reported, and immunohistochemical staining with KIT
              and CD5 was performed. Mutation analyses in the juxtamembrane
              domains (exons 9 and 11) and in the tyrosine kinase domains

              connected layers in SNNs using a spike-timing-dependent
              plasticity (STDP) rule. In our approach, sub-networks compete via
              inhibitory interactions to learn features from different
              locations of the input space. These locally-connected SNNs
              (LC-SNNs) manifest key topological features of the spatial
              interaction of biological neurons. We explore a biologically
              inspired n-gram classification approach allowing parallel
              processing over various patches of the image space. We report the

              barriers to clinical and academic productivity, research success,
              and work-life balance. We sought to determine if the Eastern
              Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) Mentoring Program
              has met its goals of fostering academic and personal growth in
              young acute care surgeons. METHODS: We conducted a systematic
              program evaluation of EAST Mentoring Program's first 4 years.
              Demographic information was collected from EAST records,
              mentorship program applications, and mentee-mentor career
              development plans. We reviewed the career development plans for
              thematic commonalities and results of a structured, online
              questionnaire distributed since program inception. A mixed
              methods approach was used to better understand the program goals
              from both mentee and mentor perspectives, as well as attitudes
              and barriers regarding the perceived success of this career
              development program. RESULTS: During 2012 to 2015, 65 mentoring
              dyads were paired and 60 completed the program. Of 184 surveys
              distributed, 108 were returned (57\% response rate). Respondents
              were evenly distributed between mentees and mentors (53 vs. 55, p
              = 0.768). In participant surveys, mentoring relationships were
              viewed to focus on research (45\%), ``sticky situations'' (e.g.,
              communication, work-life balance) (27\%), education (18\%), or
              administrative issues (10\%). Mentees were more focused on
              research and education versus mentors (74\% vs. 50\%; p = 0.040).
              Mentees felt that goals were ``always'' or ``usually'' met versus
              mentors (89\% vs. 77\%; p = 0.096). Two barriers to successful
              mentorship included time and communication, with most pairs
              communicating by email. Most respondents (91\%) planned to
              continue the relationship beyond the EAST Mentoring Program and
              recommended the experience to colleagues. CONCLUSION: Mentee
              satisfaction with the EAST Mentoring Program was high. Mentoring
              is a beneficial tool to promote success among EAST's young
              members, but differences exist between mentee and mentor
              perceptions. Revising communication expectations and time
              commitment to improve career development may help our young acute
