              first discovered in oocytes and embryos, where it has roles in
              meiosis and development. In recent years, however, has been
              implicated in many other processes, including synaptic plasticity
              and mitosis. This review aims to introduce cytoplasmic
              polyadenylation with an emphasis on the factors and elements
              mediating this process for different mRNAs and in different
              animal species. We will discuss the RNA sequence elements
              mediating cytoplasmic polyadenylation in the 3' untranslated
              regions of mRNAs, including the CPE, MBE, TCS, eCPE, and C-CPE.
              In addition to describing the role of general polyadenylation
              factors, we discuss the specific RNA binding protein families
              associated with cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements, including
              CPEB (CPEB1, CPEB2, CPEB3, and CPEB4), Pumilio (PUM2), Musashi
              (MSI1, MSI2), zygote arrest (ZAR2), ELAV like proteins (ELAVL1,

              $\gamma$H2AX foci and therefore no signs of radiation-induced
              double-strand DNA breaks. Flow cytometry indicated that 41.5\% of
              HepG2 cells were in G2/M and this rose statistically
              significantly with increasing radiation dose reaching a plateau
              at ∼47\%. Cell lysates from both cell lines were subjected to
              metabolomic analysis using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry
              (GCMS). A total of 46 metabolites could be identified by GCMS in
              HepG2 cell lysates and 29 in HMCL-7304 lysates, most of which
              occurred in HepG2 cells. Principal Components Analysis (PCA)

              significantly elevated at both 2 and 4 Gy compared with sham

              mRNA polyadenylation isoform choice. 3' untranslated regions
              regulate mRNA fate, and their choice is tightly controlled during

              physical disability. Most people with spastic CP are born with
              it, but early diagnosis is challenging, and no current biomarker
              platform readily identifies affected individuals. The aim of this
              study was to evaluate epigenetic profiles as biomarkers for
              spastic CP. A novel analysis pipeline was employed to assess DNA
              methylation patterns between peripheral blood cells of adolescent
              subjects (14.9 $\pm$ 0.3 years old) with spastic CP and controls
              at single CpG site resolution. RESULTS: Significantly hypo- and
              hyper-methylated CpG sites associated with spastic CP were
              identified. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling fully
              discriminated the CP group from the controls. Machine learning
              based classification modeling indicated a high potential for a
              diagnostic model, and 252 sets of 40 or fewer CpG sites achieved
              near-perfect accuracy within our adolescent cohorts. A pilot test
              on significantly younger subjects (4.0 $\pm$ 1.5 years old)
              identified subjects with 73\% accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent
              patients with spastic CP can be distinguished from a non-CP
              cohort based on DNA methylation patterns in peripheral blood
              cells. A clinical diagnostic test utilizing a panel of CpG sites
              may be possible using a simulated classification model. A pilot
              validation test on patients that were more than 10 years younger
              than the main adolescent cohorts indicated that distinguishing
              methylation patterns are present earlier in life. This study is

              sites plays an important role in the fine tuning of gene
              expression. New technologies for the execution of 3'-end enriched
              RNA-seq allow genome-wide detection of the genes that exhibit
              significant APA site switching between different samples. Here,
              we show that the independence test gives better results than the
              linear trend test in detecting APA site-switching events. Further
              examination suggests that the discrepancy between these two
              statistical methods arises from complex APA site-switching events
              that cannot be represented by a simple change of average 3'-UTR
              length. In theory, the linear trend test is only effective in
              detecting these simple changes. We classify the switching events
              into four switching patterns: two simple patterns (3'-UTR
              shortening and lengthening) and two complex patterns. By
              comparing the results of the two statistical methods, we show
              that complex patterns account for 1/4 of all observed switching
              events that happen between normal and cancerous human breast cell
              lines. Because simple and complex switching patterns may convey
              different biological meanings, they merit separate study. We
              therefore propose to combine both the independence test and the
              linear trend test in practice. First, the independence test
              should be used to detect APA site switching; second, the linear
              trend test should be invoked to identify simple switching events;
              and third, those complex switching events that pass independence
              testing but fail linear trend testing can be identified.",

  abstract = "To support the sharing and reuse of formally represented
              knowledge among AI systems, it is useful to define the common
              vocabulary in which shared knowledge is represented. A
              specification of a representational vocabulary for a shared
              domain of discourse---definitions of classes, relations,
              functions, and other objects---is called an ontology. This paper
              describes a mechanism for defining ontologies that are portable
              over representation systems. Definitions written in a standard
              format for predicate calculus are translated by a system called
              Ontolingua into specialized representations, including
              frame-based systems as well as relational languages. This allows
              researchers to share and reuse ontologies, while retaining the
              computational benefits of specialized implementations. We discuss
              how the translation approach to portability addresses several

              stylistic and organizational differences among representations

  abstract = "In eukaryotes, the 3' ends of RNA polymerase II-transcribed RNAs
              are generated in the majority of cases by site-specific
              endonucleolytic cleavage, followed by the addition of a poly(A)
              tail. Through alternative polyadenylation, a gene can give rise
              to multiple mRNA isoforms that differ in the length of their 3'
              UTRs and hence in their susceptibility to post-transcriptional
              regulatory factors such as microRNAs. A series of recently
              conducted high-throughput studies of poly(A) site usage revealed
              an extensive tissue-specific control and drastic changes in the
              length of mRNA 3' UTRs upon induction of proliferation in resting
              cells. To understand the dynamics of poly(A) site choice, we
              recently identified binding sites of the major pre-mRNA 3' end
              processing factors - cleavage and polyadenylation specificity
              factor (CPSF), cleavage stimulation factor (CstF), and cleavage

              CF Im in alternative polyadenylation and reveals that subunits of

              peroxidation, alpha-tocopherol, and ascorbate",
  author   = "Buettner, G R",
  abstract = "Free radicals vary widely in their thermodynamic properties,
              ranging from very oxidizing to very reducing. These thermodynamic
              properties can be used to predict a pecking order, or hierarchy,
              for free radical reactions. Using one-electron reduction
              potentials, the predicted pecking order is in agreement with
              experimentally observed free radical electron (hydrogen atom)
              transfer reactions. These potentials are also in agreement with
              experimental data that suggest that vitamin E, the primary lipid
              soluble small molecule antioxidant, and vitamin C, the terminal
              water soluble small molecule antioxidant, cooperate to protect
              lipids and lipid structures against peroxidation. Although
              vitamin E is located in membranes and vitamin C is located in
              aqueous phases, vitamin C is able to recycle vitamin E; i.e.,
              vitamin C repairs the tocopheroxyl (chromanoxyl) radical of
              vitamin E, thereby permitting vitamin E to function again as a
              free radical chain-breaking antioxidant. This review discusses:
              (i) the thermodynamics of free radical reactions that are of
              interest to the health sciences; (ii) the fundamental
              thermodynamic and kinetic properties that are associated with
              chain-breaking antioxidants; (iii) the unique interfacial nature
              of the apparent reaction of the tocopherol free radical (vitamin
              E radical) and vitamin C; and (iv) presents a hierarchy, or

  abstract = "PURPOSE: The development of computer-aided diagnostic (CAD)
              methods for lung nodule detection, classification, and
              quantitative assessment can be facilitated through a
              well-characterized repository of computed tomography (CT) scans.
              The Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) and Image Database
              Resource Initiative (IDRI) completed such a database,
              establishing a publicly available reference for the medical
              imaging research community. Initiated by the National Cancer
              Institute (NCI), further advanced by the Foundation for the
              National Institutes of Health (FNIH), and accompanied by the Food
              and Drug Administration (FDA) through active participation, this
              public-private partnership demonstrates the success of a
              consortium founded on a consensus-based process. METHODS: Seven
              academic centers and eight medical imaging companies collaborated
              to identify, address, and resolve challenging organizational,
              technical, and clinical issues to provide a solid foundation for
              a robust database. The LIDC/IDRI Database contains 1018 cases,
              each of which includes images from a clinical thoracic CT scan
              and an associated XML file that records the results of a
              two-phase image annotation process performed by four experienced
              thoracic radiologists. In the initial blinded-read phase, each
              radiologist independently reviewed each CT scan and marked
              lesions belonging to one of three categories (``nodule > or =3
              mm,'' ``nodule or =3 mm''). In the subsequent unblinded-read
              phase, each radiologist independently reviewed their own marks
              along with the anonymized marks of the three other radiologists
              to render a final opinion. The goal of this process was to
              identify as completely as possible all lung nodules in each CT
              scan without requiring forced consensus. RESULTS: The Database
              contains 7371 lesions marked ``nodule'' by at least one
              radiologist. 2669 of these lesions were marked ``nodule > or =3
              mm'' by at least one radiologist, of which 928 (34.7\%) received
              such marks from all four radiologists. These 2669 lesions include
              nodule outlines and subjective nodule characteristic ratings.
              CONCLUSIONS: The LIDC/IDRI Database is expected to provide an
              essential medical imaging research resource to spur CAD
              development, validation, and dissemination in clinical practice.",

                 magnitude of fiscal costs. We find that accommodating policies

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The influence of moderate altitude on the
              cardiovascular system in patients with metabolic syndrome has not
              been investigated sufficiently, yet. The aim of this study was to
              assess the effect of acute and mid-term exposure to moderate
              altitude (1,700 m) on endothelial function in patients with
              metabolic syndrome. METHODS: Flow-mediated (FMD) and
              nitroglycerin-mediated vasodilation (NMD) were assessed in 18
              patients with coronary risk factors on 5 occasions: (1) at
              location A (576 m), (2) on the first day at moderate altitude
              (location B, 1,700 m), (3) after 3 weeks at moderate altitude,
              (4) and (5) again at location A (6 and 16 weeks after the stay at
              moderate altitude, respectively). In addition, markers of lipid
              metabolism, serum erythropoietin and endothelin were measured.
              RESULTS: FMD on the first day at moderate altitude was similar
              compared to baseline FMD at location A (7.0 +/- 3.3 vs. 7.4 +/-
              4.6\%; NS). A 3-week stay at moderate altitude was associated
              with a significant reduction in FMD (7.4 +/- 4.6 vs. 3.8 +/-
              2.5\%; p < 0.05) despite a decrease in baseline diameter (4.5 +/-
              0.3 vs. 4.3 +/- 0.4 mm; p < 0.05). Six weeks after returning to
              location A, FMD was still reduced compared to baseline (4.3 +/-
              2.8\%; p < 0.05) and after further 16 weeks, FMD returned to
              baseline values (5.5 +/- 3.5\%). However, metabolic parameters
              improved significantly. In contrast, NMD and endothelin levels
              remained unchanged. CONCLUSION: In patients with metabolic
              syndrome, a sojourn of 3 weeks at moderate altitude leads to a
              prolonged, but reversible impairment of FMD. The discrepancy to
              improvement of other cardiovascular and metabolic parameters
              requires further investigation.",

              patients with weak D phenotypes at a gestational age ranging from
              11th to 38th week of gestation and correlated the results with
              serological analysis of cord blood after the delivery. RESULTS:
              Non-invasive prenatal foetal RHD exon 7 genotyping analyses of
              maternal plasma samples was in complete concordance with the
              serological analysis of cord blood in all 24 RhD-negative
              pregnant women delivering 12 RhD-positive and 12 RhD-negative
              newborns. RHD exon-10-specific PCR amplicons were not detected in
              2 out of 12 studied plasma samples from women bearing
              RhD-positive foetus, despite the positive amplification in RHD
              exon 7 region observed in all cases. In 1 case red cell serology
              of cord blood revealed that the mother had D-C-E-c+e+ C(w)- and
              the infant D+C-E-c+e+ C(w)+ phenotypes. RhD exon 10 real-time PCR
              analysis of cord blood was also negative. These findings may
              reflect that DC(w)- paternally inherited haplotype probably
              possesses no RHD exon 10. In another case no cord blood sample
              has been available for additional studies. The specificity of
              both RHD exon 7 and 10 systems approached 100\% since no
              RhD-positive signals were detected in women currently pregnant
              with RhD-negative foetus (n = 8). Using real-time PCR and DNA
              isolated from maternal plasma, we easily differentiated pregnant
              woman whose RBCs had a weak D phenotype (n = 4) from truly
              RhD-negative patients since the threshold cycle (C(T)) for RHD
              exon 10 or 7 amplicons reached nearly the same value like C(T)
              for control beta-globin gene amplicons detecting the total DNA
              present in maternal plasma. However in these cases foetal RhD
              status cannot be determined. CONCLUSION: Prediction offoetal RhD
              status from maternal plasma is highly accurate and enables
              implementation into clinical routine. We suggest that safe
              non-invasive prenatal foetal RHD genotyping using maternal plasma
              should involve the amplification of at least two RHD-specific
              products.",

              their evolutionary history and constraint. Here, we characterize
              human lincRNA expression patterns in nine tissues across six
              mammalian species and multiple individuals. Of the 1898 human
              lincRNAs expressed in these tissues, we find orthologous
              transcripts for 80\% in chimpanzee, 63\% in rhesus, 39\% in cow,
              38\% in mouse, and 35\% in rat. Mammalian-expressed lincRNAs show
              remarkably strong conservation of tissue specificity, suggesting
              that it is selectively maintained. In contrast, abundant
              splice-site turnover suggests that exact splice sites are not
              critical. Relative to evolutionarily young lincRNAs,
              mammalian-expressed lincRNAs show higher primary sequence
              conservation in their promoters and exons, increased proximity to
              protein-coding genes enriched for tissue-specific functions,
              fewer repeat elements, and more frequent single-exon transcripts.
              Remarkably, we find that ∼20\% of human lincRNAs are not
              expressed beyond chimpanzee and are undetectable even in rhesus.
              These hominid-specific lincRNAs are more tissue specific,

              PCR and primers and probes targeted toward exon 7 and 10 of RHD

              patients with weak D phenotypes at a gestational age ranging from
              11th to 38th week of gestation and correlated the results with

              Non-invasive prenatal foetal RHD exon 7 genotyping analyses of
              maternal plasma samples was in complete concordance with the
              serological analysis of cord blood in all 24 RhD-negative
              pregnant women delivering 12 RhD-positive and 12 RhD-negative

              2 out of 12 studied plasma samples from women bearing

              Battery performance, irreversible charge ``loss'', rate
              capability, cyclability, exfoliation of graphite and safety are
              highly dependent on the quality of the SEI. Therefore,
              understanding the actual nature and composition of SEI is of
              prime interest. If the chemistry of the SEI formation and the
              manner in which each component affects battery performance are
              understood, SEI could be tuned to improve battery performance. In
              this paper key points related to the nature, formation, and
              features of the SEI formed on carbon negative electrodes are
              discussed. SEI has been analyzed by various analytical techniques
              amongst which FTIR and XPS are most widely used. FTIR and XPS
              data of SEI and its components as published by many research

  abstract = "Zenker's diverticulum is a common pathology in the transition
              zone of the posterior hypopharynx and esophagus. Surgical
              treatment is routinely performed by ENT and general surgeons.
              Besides the traditional open transcervical diverticulectomy, the
              introduction of transoral rigid treatment led to a paradigm
              change and is now the preferred treatment option for patients who
              are fit for general anesthesia. The implementation of
              interventional flexible endoscopy has opened another new
              micro-invasive approach for patients with high morbidity. Here,
              we present the potential utilization of a flexible, single port,
              robot-assisted, and physician-controlled endoscope system to
              facilitate transoral surgical access to the hypopharynx and upper
              esophagus. Transoral surgery of the hypopharynx and upper
              esophagus was performed in human cadavers (n = 5) using the Flex
              System (Medrobotics, Raynham, USA). Anatomical landmarks were
              identified, and posterior cricothyroid myotomy was performed with
              compatible flexible instruments in all cases. The approach to the
              hypopharynx and upper esophagus using the Flex system is feasible
              in a cadaveric model. Myotomy with a flexible tool and needle
              knife (from the perspective of treatment of Zenker´s
              diverticulum) was successful in all cases. Visualization of the
              surgical site with the system's HD camera is suitable and the
              flexible instruments meet the special needs of a micro-invasive
              transoral approach. Zenker´s diverticulum can be potentially
              treated with a transoral minimally invasive approach using a
              computer-assisted flexible endoscope system. This setup could be
              of advantage in patients with reduced mobility of the cervical
              spine to prevent open transcervical surgery. In our study, the
              Flex system enabled advanced visualization of the surgical site
              and extended intervention options, compared to standard flexible
              endoscopic treatment. However, general anesthesia is mandatory
              for the presented approach. Application in live patients with
              actual pathologies of the hypopharynx and upper esophagus will
              have to prove suitability for the treatment of Zenker's
              diverticulum. Further development of the system could include
              improved instrumentation and an adoption by other disciplines

  abstract = "RATIONALE: Advanced bronchoscopy techniques such as
              electromagnetic navigation (EMN) have been studied in clinical
              trials, but there are no randomized studies comparing EMN with
              standard bronchoscopy. OBJECTIVES: To measure and identify the
              determinants of diagnostic yield for bronchoscopy in patients
              with peripheral lung lesions. Secondary outcomes included
              diagnostic yield of different sampling techniques, complications,
              and practice pattern variations. METHODS: We used the AQuIRE
              (ACCP Quality Improvement Registry, Evaluation, and Education)
              registry to conduct a multicenter study of consecutive patients
              who underwent transbronchial biopsy (TBBx) for evaluation of
              peripheral lesions. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fifteen
              centers with 22 physicians enrolled 581 patients. Of the 581
              patients, 312 (53.7\%) had a diagnostic bronchoscopy. Unadjusted
              for other factors, the diagnostic yield was 63.7\% when no radial
              endobronchial ultrasound (r-EBUS) and no EMN were used, 57.0\%
              with r-EBUS alone, 38.5\% with EMN alone, and 47.1\% with EMN
              combined with r-EBUS. In multivariate analysis, peripheral
              transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA), larger lesion size,
              nonupper lobe location, and tobacco use were associated with
              increased diagnostic yield, whereas EMN was associated with lower
              diagnostic yield. Peripheral TBNA was used in 16.4\% of cases.
              TBNA was diagnostic, whereas TBBx was nondiagnostic in 9.5\% of
              cases in which both were performed. Complications occurred in 13
              (2.2\%) patients, and pneumothorax occurred in 10 (1.7\%)
              patients. There were significant differences between centers and
              physicians in terms of case selection, sampling methods, and
              anesthesia. Medical center diagnostic yields ranged from 33 to
              73\% (P = 0.16). CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral TBNA improved diagnostic
              yield for peripheral lesions but was underused. The diagnostic
              yields of EMN and r-EBUS were lower than expected, even after
              adjustment.",

              screening for lung cancer among smokers using low-dose computed
              tomographic (LDCT) scans. The cost-effectiveness of screening in
              a publically funded health care system remains a concern.
              OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of LDCT scan
              screening for lung cancer within the Canadian health care system.
              DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Cancer Risk Management
              Model (CRMM) simulated individual lives within the Canadian
              population from 2014 to 2034, incorporating cancer risk, disease
              management, outcome, and cost data. Smokers and former smokers
              eligible for lung cancer screening (30 pack-year smoking history,
              ages 55-74 years, for the reference scenario) were modeled, and
              performance parameters were calibrated to the National Lung
              Screening Trial (NLST). The reference screening scenario assumes
              annual scans to age 75 years, 60\% participation by 10 years,
              70\% adherence to screening, and unchanged smoking rates. The
              CRMM outputs are aggregated, and costs (2008 Canadian dollars)
              and life-years are discounted 3\% annually. MAIN OUTCOMES AND
              MEASURES: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS:
              Compared with no screening, the reference scenario saved 51,000
              quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) and had an incremental
              cost-effectiveness ratio of CaD $52,000/QALY. If smoking history
              is modeled for 20 or 40 pack-years, incremental
              cost-effectiveness ratios of CaD $62,000 and CaD $43,000/QALY,
              respectively, were generated. Changes in participation rates
              altered life years saved but not the incremental
              cost-effectiveness ratio, while the incremental
              cost-effectiveness ratio is sensitive to changes in adherence. An
              adjunct smoking cessation program improving the quit rate by
              22.5\% improves the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio to CaD
              $24,000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Lung cancer screening
              with LDCT appears cost-effective in the publicly funded Canadian
              health care system. An adjunct smoking cessation program has the
              potential to improve outcomes.",

              with short product life cycles, product development must not only
              satisfy the quality and speed of production, but it must ensure
              that products themselves have included innovative values. As
              creativity plays an important role in new product development
              (NPD), it can be utilized in search of novel ideas for innovative
              product design, and also can be regarded as a helpful tool in
              advancing NPD output. In this paper, we developed a creativity
              method based on the naturally sensuous ability of human beings.
              We also proposed a creativity-based design process integrating
              some systematic design methodologies with a developed creativity
              tool. The essence of this proposed design process is not the sole
              performance of the creativity tool but the coherent efforts among
              each involved process technique. To prove the practicability of
              this design process, a case study was conducted according to
              various procedures that were followed. By applying evolutionary
              thinking, the sensuous association method, and other systematic
              approaches to the design process, a number of concept solutions
              were produced. An optimal solution was then determined by using
              an operative decision-making model based on the weighted

              effectively assist designers in encouraging design creativity,

              prostatectomy (RARP), and to assess improvements in performance
              and ability to perform RARP after completion of the curriculum.
              DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A 12-wk training curriculum
              was developed based on an expert panel discussion and used to
              train ten fellows from major European teaching institutions. The
              curriculum included: (1) e-learning, (2) 1 wk of structured
              simulation-based training (virtual reality synthetic, animal, and
              cadaveric platforms), and (3) supervised modular training for
              RARP. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The
              feasibility, acceptability, face validity, and educational impact
              were assessed using quantitative surveys. Improvement in the
              technical skills of participants over the training period was
              evaluated using the inbuilt validated assessment metrics on the
              da Vinci surgical simulator (dVSS). A final RARP performed by
              fellows on completion of their training was assessed using the
              Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills (GEARS) score and
              generic and procedure-specific scoring criteria. RESULTS AND
              LIMITATIONS: The median baseline experience of participants as
              console surgeon was 4 mo (interquartile range [IQR] 0-6.5 mo).
              All participants completed the curriculum and were involved in a
              median of 18 RARPs (IQR 14-36) during modular training. The
              overall score for dVSS tasks significantly increased over the
              training period (p10 (scale 4-16) for all procedural steps using
              a generic dedicated scoring tool. In performance comparison using
              this scoring tool, the experts significantly outperformed the
              fellows (mean score for all steps 13.6 vs 11). CONCLUSIONS: The
              European robot-assisted urologic training curriculum is
              acceptable, valid, and effective for training in RARP. PATIENT

              program including simulation-based training and mentored training
              in the operating room allows surgeons with limited robotic
              experience to increase their robotic skills and their ability to

              also reviewed. A comprehensive search of PubMed, EMBASE, the
              Cochrane Library, and Web of Knowledge was performed. Since the
              inception of TAMIS in 2009, 33 retrospective studies and case
              reports, and 3 abstracts have been published on TAMIS for local
              excision of rectal neoplasms, which represents a combined n = 390
              TAMIS procedures performed worldwide using eight different types
              of TAMIS platforms. A total of 152 lesions were excised for
              benign disease including adenomas and high-grade dysplasias (39
              \%), 209 for malignancy for carcinomas in situ and
              adenocarcinomas (53.5 \%). Twenty-nine (7.5 \%) of TAMIS
              resections were for other pathology, of which the majority
              (23/29) were neuroendocrine lesions. The remaining resections
              were for mucocele, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, melanoma, and
              fibrosis. Robotic-TAMIS has also been reported, however, data are
              extremely limited as there are only 7 case reports (combined n =
              11) in the published literature. Success with Robotic-TAMIS has
              been demonstrated with various patient positions and by use of a
              special glove port. Transanal total mesorectal excision using the
              TAMIS platform has also been demonstrated is several small
              series, and the feasibility of performing pure transanal total
              mesorectal excision has also been reported. Combined, n = 78
              cases of transanal total mesorectal excision have been performed
              using TAMIS. The advantages of TAMIS-assisted transanal total
              mesorectal excision are discussed.",

              hand motion, thereby reducing negative outcomes. This study aimed
              to develop a microsurgical robot for vitreoretinal surgery and to
              perform clinical procedures using robot-assisted interventions.
              Methods A microsurgical system for vitreoretinal surgery was
              designed to meet specific requirements for the degree of freedom,
              accuracy, and workspace. The system was intended to provide
              micrometer accurate manipulation within the eye. The slave
              manipulator has a tool change mechanism for switching surgical
              instruments. The slave manipulator is controlled by the surgeon
              using a master manipulator consisting of multiple joints. Results
              The robotic system was used to carry out microcannulation
              experiments on a pig's eye. A surgeon was able to successfully
              perform microcannulation. Conclusions This microsurgical robotic
              vitreoretinal surgical system showed superior operability
              compared with a traditional manual procedure, and it demonstrated

  abstract = "Background This paper presents a novel alternative for the
              treatment of lung cancer. The method consists of accessing the
              lung through small incisions in a minimally invasive manner in
              order to insert radioactive seeds directly into the lung using a
              robotic surgical system. Methods An experimental test-bed to
              evaluate the feasibility of this approach has been developed. It
              consists of two surgical robotic systems, a device specifically
              designed to robotically implant radioactive seeds, needle
              tracking software, ultrasound imaging, electromagnetic tracking,
              and a surgical box that mimics a patient's thorax. A detailed
              comparison has been performed between currently available access
              options and robot-assisted minimally invasive access. Results The
              results show insignificant differences in accuracy between the
              methods, with the exception of a significant improvement when
              electromagnetic (EM) guidance was added to the non-robotic
              techniques. The navigation system reduced the number of attempts
              for all seed delivery methods. Significant reductions in time
              were achieved in the minimally invasive procedures by the
              addition of EM guidance. Conclusions The performance achieved
              when using robotic systems and image guidance for
              minimally-invasive brachytherapy is clinically comparable to that
              acieved in an open surgery procedure, while reducing the
              invasiveness of the procedure, improving ergonomic conditions for
              the clinician and reducing radiation exposure. Copyright

              Results 19 patients were identified who underwent a combined

              localize the lesion. Five patients did not have a needle biopsy

              skills. We developed a robotic intubation system (Kepler
              intubation system, KIS) for oral tracheal intubation. METHODS: In
              this pilot study, 12 patients were enrolled after approval of the
              local Ethics board and written informed consent. The KIS consists
              of four main components: a ThrustMaster T.Flight Hotas X joystick
              (Guillemot Inc., New York, NY, USA), a JACO robotic arm (Kinova
              Rehab, Montreal, QC, Canada), a Pentax AWS video laryngoscope
              (Ambu A/S, Ballerup, Denmark), and a software control system. The
              joystick allows simulation of the wrist or arm movements of a
              human operator. The success rate of intubation and intubation
              times were measured. RESULTS: Eleven men and one woman aged 66 yr
              were included in this study. Intubation was successful in all but
              one patient using KIS at a total time of [median (inter-quartile
              range; range)] 93 (87, 109; 76, 153) s; in one patient, fogging
              of the video laryngoscope prevented intubation using KIS.
              CONCLUSIONS: We present the first human testing of a robotic
              intubation system for oral tracheal intubation. The success rate
              was high at 91\%. Future studies are needed to assess the

              However, due to significant acute and late toxicities there has
              been increasing interest in minimally invasive surgical
              approaches, particularly transoral robotic surgery (TORS) in an
              attempt to preserve patient quality of life while maintaining
              oncologic outcomes. The aim of this study was to review the
              current literature in order to compare primary IMRT versus TORS
              in the management of OPSCC. Methods A MEDLINE search was
              conducted to identify studies reporting on the outcomes of TORS
              or IMRT in the treatment of OPSCC. Reference lists were also
              reviewed for relevant articles. Oncologic, functional, and
              quality of life data is summarized and discussed. Results One
              hundred-ninety papers were identified through the MEDLINE search.
              An additional 52 papers were retrieved by hand searching the
              reference lists. Ultimately, 44 papers were identified that
              discussed outcomes after IMRT or TORS for OPSCC. No outcomes from
              randomized trials were identified. Conclusion No randomized
              trials comparing TORS versus IMRT to each other were identified.
              Uncontrolled reports from the current literature suggest
              comparable oncologic outcomes with TORS compared to IMRT and
              functional outcomes may be superior. However, the median

              model with a 5-year time horizon was developed. Comparative
              groups were: i) TORS with concurrent ipsilateral neck dissection
              +/− adjunctive IMRT, and ii) primary IMRT. Primary outcome was
              cost/quality adjusted life year (QALY). Perspective was the
              United States third party payer. Costs and effects were
              discounted at a rate of 3.5\%. A threshold and probabilistic
              sensitivity analysis were performed. Results TORS strategy cost
              $30,992 and provided 4.81 QALYs/patient. The IMRT strategy cost
              $26,033 and provided a total of 4.78 QALYs/patient. The
              incremental cost effectiveness ratio for TORS vs. IMRT in the

              cost-effective compared to IMRT at a maximum willingness-to-pay
              threshold of $50,000/QALY is 42\%. Conclusion An IMRT strategy
              for management of early stage OPSCC is more likely to be

              advanced distal rectal tumors with a poor response to neoadjuvant
              treatment. Transanal (TaTME) is a new natural orifice
              translumenal endoscopic surgery modality in which the rectum is
              mobilized transanally using endoscopic techniques with or without
              laparoscopic assistance. We conducted a comprehensive systematic
              review of publications on this new technique in PubMed and Embase
              databases from January, 2008, to July, 2014. Experimental and
              clinical studies written in English were included. Experimental
              research with TaTME was done on pigs with and without survival
              models and on human cadavers. In these studies, laparoscopic or
              transgastric assistance was frequently used resulting in an
              easier upper rectal dissection and in a longer rectal specimen.
              To date, 150 patients in 16 clinical studies have undergone
              TaTME. In all but 15 cases, transabdominal assistance was used. A
              rigid transanal endoscopic operations/transanal endoscopic
              microsurgery (TEO/TEM) platform was used in 37 patients. Rectal
              adenocarcinoma was the indication in all except for nine cases of
              benign diseases. Operative times ranged from 90 to 460 min. TME
              quality was deemed intact, satisfactory, or complete. Involvement
              in circumferential resection margins was detected in 16 (11.8 \%)
              patients. The mean lymph node harvest was equal or greater than
              12 in all studies. Regarding morbidity, pneumoretroperitoneum,
              damage to the urethra, and air embolism were reported
              intraoperatively. Mean hospital stay varied from 4 to 14 days.
              Postoperative complications occurred in 34 (22.7 \%) patients.
              TaTME with TEM is feasible in selected cases. Oncologic safety

              complications and functional outcome of patients. Results All 60
              patients underwent TORS, with neck dissection performed in 45 of
              the patients. A positive margin was seen in two patients (3.3
              \%). Intent to treatment was radical in 42 patients and salvage
              in 18 patients. None of the patients required tracheostomy, and
              one patient (1.66 \%) died postoperatively. Postoperative
              complications in the form of primary haemorrhage required active
              intervention in three patients. Average estimated blood loss was
              26.5 $\pm$ 31.1 ml. Postoperatively, all patients had adequate
              swallowing and speech function with nasal twang reported in three
              patients on long-term follow up. Patients started tolerating oral
              feeds within a week of procedure (mean 3.96 days), with the
              nasogastric tube removed on the ninth postoperative day (mean
              9.19 days). No long-term gastrostomy tube dependency was
              reported. Conclusion TORS is a safe, feasible, minimally invasive
              procedure in patients with oropharyngeal cancers. It has the
              least morbidity and offers benefits in terms of avoidance of

              benefit of combining TORS with a carbon dioxide (CO2) laser in
              resecting upper aerodigestive tract tumors. The purpose of this
              study was to illustrate transoral robot-assisted carbon dioxide
              laser surgery (TORS-L) for hypopharyngeal cancers. Methods A
              59-year-old patient with T1N0M0 cancer at the lateral
              hypopharyngeal wall was selected for TORS-L. Results Tumor was
              excised in 1 piece with adequate surgical margins. There was no
              perioperative complication. The patient was extubated immediately
              after surgery. Oral diet was initiated within the first 24 hours.
              No gastrostomy or tracheostomy tube placement was required. A

              endoscopic surgery (NOTES) has not yet become widely accepted and
              to prove whether the main reason is still the lack of appropriate
              platforms due to the deficiency of applicable interfaces.
              Methods. To assess expectations of a suitable interface design,
              we performed a survey on human--machine interfaces for NOTES
              mechatronic support systems among surgeons, gastroenterologists,
              and medical engineers. Of 120 distributed questionnaires, each
              consisting of 14 distinct questions, 100 (83\%) were eligible for
              analysis. Results. A mechatronic platform for NOTES was
              considered ``important'' by 71\% of surgeons, 83\% of
              gastroenterologist,s and 56\% of medical engineers.
              ``Intuitivity'' and ``simple to use'' were the most favored
              aspects (33\% to 51\%). Haptic feedback was considered
              ``important'' by 70\% of participants. In all, 53\% of surgeons,
              50\% of gastroenterologists, and 33\% of medical engineers
              already had experience with NOTES platforms or other surgical
              robots; however, current interfaces only met expectations in just
              more than 50\%. Whereas surgeons did not favor a certain working
              posture, gastroenterologists and medical engineers preferred a
              sitting position. Three-dimensional visualization was generally
              considered ``nice to have'' (67\% to 72\%); however, for 26\% of
              surgeons, 17\% of gastroenterologists, and 7\% of medical
              engineers it did not matter (P = 0.018). Conclusion. Requests and
              expectations of human--machine interfaces for NOTES seem to be
              generally similar for surgeons, gastroenterologist, and medical
              engineers. Consensus exists on the importance of developing
              interfaces that should be both intuitive and simple to use, are
              similar to preexisting familiar instruments, and exceed current

              operation. Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery
              (NOTES) offers a great new potential for pancreatic procedures,
              with early data showing benefits of reduced visible scarring and
              the potential for decreased wound infections, hernias, pain, and
              postoperative complications. However, there are significant
              limitations to the currently used flexible endoscopy tools,
              including a diminished visual field, spatial orientation and
              tissue manipulation issues, and 2-dimensional visual feedback. We
              have adopted a novel snake-like robot, the minimally invasive
              cardiac surgery (MICS) robot, which addresses these issues. In
              the current pilot study, the MICS robot was evaluated for
              transrectal distal pancreas exploration and resection in 2
              nonsurvival porcine models. Abdominal navigation and accessing
              the pancreas was investigated in the first pig, and based on its
              success, pancreas resection was studied in pig 2. The MICS robot
              was successful in accessing and visualizing the right upper, left
              upper, and left lower quadrants of the abdomen in pig 1 and was
              able to perform a successful complex NOTES procedure with distal
              pancreas resection in pig 2, with only minimal laparoscopic
              retraction assistance. In conclusion, preliminary results showing
              the MICS robot in natural orifice distal pancreatectomy are
              positive. Enhancements to optics and instrumentation will help
              further increase the usability in pancreatic interventions.

              surgical times. More recently, transoral endoscopic thyroidectomy
              has overcome the limitations of previous approaches. Herein, we
              present our initial experience with transoral periosteal
              thyroidectomy (TOPOT) in cadaver and porcine models. Using these
              models, the surgical view was improved and had greater freedom of
              motion; the technique was then performed in human subjects using
              robotic TOPOT, which has not previously been reported. Method
              TOPOTs were performed in seven fresh human cadavers and ten live
              pigs. Total thyroidectomies were performed in all cadavers and
              pigs. After the cadaver and animal trials, four human patients
              underwent robotic TOPOT performed using the da
              Vinci\textregistered{} surgical system at Korea University Anam
              Hospital. Recurrent laryngeal nerve function, intra- and
              postoperative complications, and postoperative outcomes were
              assessed in all patients. Result One left lobectomy for

              become well established as one of the standard treatment options
              for T1 and T2 oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Besides this
              main indication, TORS can provide with improved access to other

              supraglottic larynx and the hypopharynx, with superior visibility
              and maneuverability to that of transoral laser microsurgery
              (TOLM). Since September 2011, over one hundred TORS procedures
              have been performed at our institution, predominantly for
              oropharyngeal cancer. As part of our first 50 transoral robotic
              cases making up our initial TORS-trial, five patients underwent
              TORS for early hypopharyngeal carcinoma. The present case series
              evaluates its feasibility, safety and the completeness of
              resection in this well-defined subgroup of patients. Main outcome
              measures were completeness of resection, the presence or lack of
              postoperative bleeding, number of days intubated, rate of
              elective tracheotomy, duration of intensive care and/or
              intermediate care, speech and swallowing function, and duration
              of nasogastric and/or gastrostomy tube dependency. All patients
              have been free of recurrence to date. One patient died of other
              disease. Four patients are alive and free of tumour, three of
              them did not need adjuvant therapy. Transoral robotic surgery
              with appropriate neck dissection is a valid primary treatment
              option for select early hypopharyngeal carcinoma, especially in
              cases that did not require adjuvant treatment. In contrast to
              TOLM, TORS allows a multi-planar en bloc resection in the
              hypopharynx which makes histopathological evaluation more
              reliable. In addition to this, its faster learning curve makes
              the results less dependent on the individual surgeons'

              invitation to explore and treat the inner passages of the
              organism. However, surgical ingenuity needed to be matched by
              appropriate tools and devices. Lack of technologically advanced
              instrumentation was a strong deterrent during almost a millennium
              until recent decades when a quantum jump materialized. Endoscopic
              surgery is currently a vibrant and growing subspecialty, which
              successfully handles millions of patients every year. Additional
              opportunities lie ahead which might benefit millions more,

              study was to investigate whether anatomic biometric measures are
              useful to determine the feasibility of performing TORS. Methods
              Three surgeons independently evaluated feasibility in 51 soft-fix
              cadavers. Transoral visualization was performed with 2 retractors
              commonly used in TORS. Seven anthropometric parameters and the

              capable of performing some of the most complex thoracic
              procedures. The idea of operating through fewer surgical

              stability and for achieving differences in movement accuracy. In
              the present study, we have examined the voluntary control of
              postural stiffness in 3D in the human jaw. The goal is to address
              the possible role of stiffness control in both stabilizing the
              jaw and in achieving the differential precision requirements of
              speech sounds. We previously showed that patterns of kinematic
              variability in speech are systematically related to the stiffness
              of the jaw. If the nervous system uses stiffness control as a
              means to regulate kinematic variation in speech, it should also
              be possible to show that subjects can voluntarily modify jaw
              stiffness. Using a robotic device, a series of force pulses was
              applied to the jaw to elicit changes in stiffness to resist
              displacement. Three orthogonal directions and three magnitudes of
              forces were tested. In all conditions, subjects increased the
              magnitude of jaw stiffness to resist the effects of the applied
              forces. Apart from the horizontal direction, greater increases in
              stiffness were observed when larger forces were applied.
              Moreover, subjects differentially increased jaw stiffness along a
              vertical axis to counteract disturbances in this direction. The
              observed changes in the magnitude of stiffness in different
              directions suggest an ability to control the pattern of stiffness
              of the jaw. The results are interpreted as evidence that jaw
              stiffness can be adjusted voluntarily, and thus may play a role
              in stabilizing the jaw and in controlling movement variation in
              the orofacial system.",

              traditional style of surgical operations. Laparoscopic
              cholecystectomy has spread rapidly and is now established as the
              standard treatment. However, besides cholecystectomy, endoscopic
              procedures are still not applied so widely to a variety of
              surgical operations. This is because laparoscopic techniques,
              such as suturing or ligation, make it difficult for surgeons to
              perform other kinds of operations and thus greatly increase their
              mental and physical stress. It is necessary to introduce various
              advanced technologies such as: surgical robots, three dimensional
              (3D) images, computer graphics (CG), computer simulation
              technology and others. Surgical robots, including the AESOP, da

              advanced vision and hand skills. As a result, such systems are

              questionnaire showed significant advantage for robotic FURS
              (total score: 5.6 vs 31.3; p < 0.01). A 10/12F-access sheath was
              used in 72 patients. Two cases required secondary FURS, one
              because of malfunction of the flexible digital ureteroscope and
              another because of larger residual fragments. In the remaining 79
              cases, complete stone disintegration was accomplished.
              Conclusions Roboflex Avicenna provides a suitable and safe
              platform for robotic FURS with significant improvement of
              ergonomics. Future studies should evaluate its impact on the
              clinical outcome of FURS. Patient summary Robotic flexible
              ureteroscopy (FURS) was performed with the Roboflex Avicenna
              robotic device. Results showed that Roboflex Avicenna provides a

              approval and informed consent 18 patients with renal calculi
              underwent flexible robotic ureteroscopy. Study inclusion criteria
              were 5 to 15 mm renal calculi. Patients with ureteral calculi or
              obstruction, uncontrolled infection, renal insufficiency or
              solitary kidney were excluded from analysis. The flexible robotic
              catheter system was manually introduced into the renal collecting
              system over a guidewire under fluoroscopic control. All
              intrarenal maneuvers, including stone relocation and
              fragmentation into 1 to 2 mm particles, were done exclusively
              from the remote robotic console. Results All procedures were
              technically successful without conversion to manual ureteroscopy.
              Mean stone size was 11.9 mm, mean robot docking time was 7.3
              minutes, mean stone localization time was 8.7 minutes, mean total
              robot time was 41.4 minutes and mean total operative time was 91
              minutes. The mean visual analog scale rating on a scale of
              1---worst to 10---best was 8.5 for robotic control, 9.0 for
              stability and 9.2 for fragmentation ease. There were no
              intraoperative complications. Postoperative complications
              included transient fever in 2 cases and temporary limb paresis in
              1. One patient required secondary percutaneous nephrolithotomy
              for residual stone. Based on computerized tomogram/excretory
              urogram the complete stone clearance rate at 2 and 3 months was
              56\% and 89\%, respectively. At 3 months all patients had stable

               delivery. For many therapeutic scenarios, a large team of
               micromachines is required, but a convincing approach for
               controlling individual team members is currently missing. We
               present a method for selective control of identical helical
               micromachines based on their spatial position. The micromachines
               are operated by uniform rotating fields, whereas spatial
               selection is achieved by application of a strong field gradient
               that locks all machines except those located inside a small
               movable volume. We deliver experimental evidence of
               three-dimensional selective actuation with a spatial selectivity
               on the order of millimeters over a workspace large enough for
               clinical applications. Selective control of teams of helical
               micromachines may improve minimally invasive therapeutic
               approaches and may lead to more flexible local drug delivery
               systems or adaptive medical implants. As an example, we propose
               a concept for adaptive radiation treatment in cancer therapy
               based on selective switching of radioactive sources distributed
               inside a tumor.",

              since the original advent of conventional multiport laparoscopic
              surgery. The recent development of single incision laparoscopic
              surgery remains a relatively novel technique, and has had mixed
              reviews as to whether it has been associated with lower pain
              scores, shorter hospital stays, and higher satisfaction levels
              among patients undergoing procedures through
              cosmetically-appeasing single incisions. However, due to
              technical difficulties that arise from the clustering of
              laparoscopic instruments through a confined working space, such
              as loss of instrument triangulation, poor surgical exposure, and
              instrument clashing, uptake by surgeons without a specific
              interest and expertise in cutting-edge minimally invasive
              approaches has been limited. The parallel use of robotic surgery
              with single-port platforms, however, appears to counteract
              technical issues associated with single incision laparoscopic

              2.5 million, and it is expected that this number will rise to 5
              million by 2030.1 Surgical intervention is recommended for
              symptomatic severe MR or asymptomatic severe MR with left
              ventricular (LV) dysfunction.2 Treatment of degenerative MR has
              evolved from mitral valve (MV) replacement to MV repair because
              of superior long-term outcomes after repair.2--4 For functional
              MR, however, the benefit over MV replacement is less certain.5 In
              addition, minimally invasive MV surgery has become a
              well-established and increasingly used option for managing
              patients with MV pathology.6 Although surgery remains the gold
              standard treatment for significant MR, MV surgery is deferred in
              a large number of patients because of high surgical risk.7 The
              decrease in the prevalence of rheumatic valve disease, in
              combination with an increased life expectancy, has led to a high
              prevalence of degenerative MR. As a consequence, patients are
              older and present with comorbidities that increase operative
              mortality and morbidity risks.8 In octogenarians, there has been
              reported a mortality and morbidity rate of 17.0\% and 35.5\%,

              significant MR---the Euro Heart Survey revealed that up to 50\%
              of patients hospitalized with symptomatic severe MR are not
              referred for MV surgery, mainly because of advanced age,
              comorbidities, and LV dysfunction. In patients aged $\geq$80

              surgeon-driven systems, such as the daVinci (Intuitive Surgical
              Inc., USA, www.intuitivesurgical.com). These have already enabled
              surgery that was unattainable with classic instrumentation;
              however, at their present level of development, they have limited
              utility. The drawback of these systems is that they are
              independent self-contained units, and as such, they do not
              directly take advantage of patient data. The potential of these
              new surgical tools lies much further ahead. Integration with
              medical imaging and information are needed for these devices to
              achieve their true potential. Surgical robots and especially
              their subclass of image-guided systems require special design,
              construction and control compared to industrial types, due to the
              special requirements of the medical and imaging environments.
              Imager compatibility raises significant engineering challenges
              for the development of robotic manipulators with respect to
              imager access, safety, ergonomics, and above all the
              non-interference with the functionality of the imager. These
              apply to all known medical imaging types, but are especially
              challenging for achieving compatibility with the class of MRI
              systems. Even though a large majority of robotic components may
              be redesigned to be constructed of MRI compatible materials, for
              other components such as the motors used in actuation,
              prescribing MRI compatible materials alone is not sufficient. The
              electromagnetic motors most commonly used in robotic actuation,
              for example, are incompatible by principle. As such, alternate
              actuation principles using ``intervention friendly'' energy
              should be adopted and/or devised for these special surgical and
              radiological interventions. This paper defines the new concept of
              Multi-Imager Compatibility of surgical manipulators and describes
              its requirements. Subsequently, the paper gives several
              recommendations and proposes new actuation principles for this
              concept. Several implementations have been constructed and

              combined with fundus-first, dome-down separation,'' which mainly
              uses conventional rigid laparoscopic instruments. In this study,
              we demonstrated our technique and retrospectively evaluated the
              clinical outcomes. Subjects and Methods: Three trocars were set
              through a 2.0-cm transumbilical minilaparotomy that was covered
              with an EZ Access™ combined with a lap protector. To create an
              adequate surgical field, the teres ligament was laparoscopically
              hung up with a suture on a straight needle. The gall bladder was
              then dissected through the fundus to the neck using rigid
              laparoscopic instruments without any additional trocars. At our
              institution, 18 consecutive patients underwent SILC using our
              technique from January 2014 to August 2015. Each patient had a
              symptomatic gallbladder (GB) stone or polyp. All operations were
              performed by surgeons who had never performed SILC until this

              completed without GB perforation or other intraoperative
              complications. Additional trocars or open laparotomy were not
              required. The median operation time was 79 minutes, and blood
              loss was negligible. No postoperative complications were
              encountered. Conclusions: Our novel procedure is safe and
              feasible. Even for surgeons who have never performed SILC before,
              our technique may become a standard for benign GB disease without
              requiring the use of articulating devices or additional trocars.",

              responses to critical events. The beliefs and values that typify

                 their creative ideas. Crowdfunding involves relatively small
                 contributions of many consumer-investors over a fixed time
                 limit (generally a few weeks). In online crowdfunding
                 communities, potential donors can see the level of support
                 from other project backers as well as its timing before making
                 their own funding decisions, suggesting that social
                 information (i.e., others' funding decisions) will play an
                 important role in the ultimate success of a project. Two years
                 of publicly available panel data on successfully and
                 unsuccessfully funded projects listed on Kickstarter is used
                 to empirically study the role of social information in the
                 dynamic behavior of project backers. Building off the
                 well-established social psychology theory around diffusion of
                 responsibility effects, we show that additional backer support
                 is negatively related to its past backer support. Many
                 potential backers do not contribute to a project that has
                 already received a lot of support because they assume that
                 others will provide the necessary funding. Consistent with the
                 deadline effect widely observed in bargaining and online
                 auctions, we also show that the diffusion of responsibility
                 effects diminish as the project funding cycle approaches its
                 closing date. Moreover, as the project deadline draws near we
                 find that project updates tend to increase as the project
                 creators make a final plea for help to reach their funding
                 goal. Reduced diffusion of responsibility effects, together
                 with the positive influence of project updates, lead to
                 generally increasing project support in the final stages of
                 funding. This is particularly the case for projects that
                 successfully achieve their goals as they are more likely to
                 have an update in the last weeks of funding and generate more

  abstract = "The growing complexity of problems requires collective solutions
              to produce creative outcomes. Organizational theory on creativity
              has been extensively developed in recent decades, but two
              problematic issues remain. First, no current comprehensive model
              explains the development of collective creativity. Second, no
              empirical research has been conducted on the process of theory
              dissemination and its relevance within the managerial community.
              This paper provides evidence which can inform the design of
              collective creative projects within organizations, flying in the
              face of some managerial clich{\'e}s. We design a research project
              which enables managerial sensemaking to emerge and which proposes
              a comprehensive approach to the design of team creativity. From a
              research design involving 24 managers and 98 eleven-person
              groups, results confirm that creativity is not only about
              creative genius, and design for creativity is not a matter of
              linear correlation but implies a more sophisticated and
              integrative approach according to which individual creative
              skills, team dynamics and organizational solutions interact with
              each other to produce a collective creative performance.",

              companies are exploring new ways to involve design consultants in
              their innovation processes. Many studies have underlined the
              importance of designers in the innovation processes of successful
              companies, and some designers have achieved `superstar' status.
              By capturing, recombining and integrating socio-cultural
              knowledge and product semantics across social and industrial
              settings, designers can help create breakthrough product
              meanings. The relationship between briefs written by managers and
              solutions developed by designers is quite complex. Very often
              managers are unable to appropriately communicate and
              commercialize new products and services conceptualized by
              designers because they know only the final output of the
              innovation process rather than its entire story. The Language
              Brokering Process can enrich the dialectic between managers and
              designers, and consequently, it can improve both current and
              future innovation projects. This methodology elucidates the
              structure and process adopted by several designers and also
              illustrates an effective framework for communicating choices to
              managers. We present results from a student application of this
              methodology in the development of a new product-service system

              prevalence of medical disorders totally descriptively,'' he told
              a BBC documentary in 2007, ``without considering that many of
              these conditions might be normal reactions which are not really
              disorders, because we were not looking at the context in which
              those conditions developed.''4 They had, he agreed, ``to some
              extent'' medicalised much of ``ordinary human sadness, fear,
              ordinary experiences.''This is one of the key criticisms of
              DSM-55---and few have presented it as eloquently as Frank Farley,
              the former president of the American Psychological Association,
              who takes personal exception to the widely condemned decision to
              remove from DSM-5 an exclusion clause that prevents bereavement
              being diagnosed as a major depressive disorder for up to two
              months after the death of a loved one.``Grieving is normal,'' he
              says, ``and if you grieve for more than two months should you be
              labelled with some kind of mental illness---and that's the
              terminology that the public will pick up on? The answer is
              clearly no. My first wife died three decades ago; I don't grieve
              in the usual way that I did for a long time after she passed
              away, but I still think of her and I still have emotional
              memories. Nothing wrong with that---it's human nature.''Farley,
              like many critics, is concerned about DSM-5's contribution to
              what he calls ``the relentless production of disorders and
              pathologising of normal extremes.'' It isn't a new charge. In
              1999 DSM-IV came under fire for facilitating ``the creation of
              mental illness.''6But it remains true, says Farley, that
              psychiatry and psychology in general need to be ``better
              connected with the real world. I worry that we have too much of
              the monastic science in us; too many laboratory studies. People
              don't live in laboratories, they don't grieve in laboratories,
              they don't feel pain in laboratories.''The American Psychiatric
              Association, which has invited criticism and contributions
              throughout the long revision process, and since 2010 has received
              an ``unprecedented'' 15 000 comments,7 has always been vigorous
              in defending its position. But its defence of the removal of the
              ``bereavement exclusion,'' written by a member of the DSM-5 mood
              disorder work group, seems to confirm wider fears that the
              association's committee led system for selecting disorders for
              inclusion is a recipe for disorder escalation.The grief exclusion
              criteria, wrote Kenneth Kendler of the Virginia Institute for
              Psychiatric and Behavioural Genetics, in a document posted on the
              APA website in 2011, had been added to DSM-III ``largely on the
              basis of the work of one of the DSM-III task force members who
              was then studying grief and was carried forward with little

              diagnosis and prognosis, and genome-guided therapy and dose
              selection are just among the few important examples for which
              genome information has already enabled personalized health care
              along the continuum from health to disease. In addition,
              information from individual genomes, which is a fast-moving area
              of technological development, is spawning a social and
              information revolution among consumers that will undoubtedly
              affect health care decision making. Although these and other
              scientific findings are making their way from the genome to the
              clinic, the full application of genomic and personalized medicine
              in health care will require dramatic changes in regulatory and
              reimbursement policies as well as legislative protections for
              privacy for system-wide adoption. Thus, there are challenges from
              both a scientific and a policy perspective to personalized health
              care; however, they will be confronted and solved with the
              certainty that the science behind genomic medicine is sound and
              the practice of medicine that it informs is evidence based.",

              strategy will have to be used. Nurse practitioners recognize

              maintenance activity is becoming both an increasingly important
              policy issue and a topic of interest to health services
              researchers. Such activity may help the elderly to delay the
              onset of the health---related problems associated with aging,
              maintain if not improve their functional abilities, and perhaps
              improve their quality of life. Methods. Using a conceptual model
              largely based upon the health belief model, this study sought to
              examine predictors of variability of health maintenance activity
              among older persons. The project included cross-sectional data
              drawn from the first phase of a multiyear panel study of elderly

              and logistic regression analyses of seven types of health

              in order for levels of health maintenance activity to be

               designed to reduce the incidence of falls in older people living
               in the community. Search methodsSearch methods We searched the

               trials of interventions to reduce falls in community-dwelling
               older people. Data collection and analysisData collection and
               analysis Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias
               and extracted data. We used a rate ratio (RaR) and 95\%
               confidence interval (CI) to compare the rate of falls (e.g.
               falls per person year) between intervention and control groups.
               For risk of falling, we used a risk ratio (RR) and 95\% CI based
               on the number of people falling (fallers) in each group. We
               pooled data where appropriate. Main resultsMain results We
               included 159 trials with 79,193 participants. Most trials
               compared a fall prevention intervention with no intervention or
               an intervention not expected to reduce falls. The most common
               interventions tested were exercise as a single intervention (59
               trials) and multifactorial programmes (40 trials). Sixty-two per
               cent (99/159) of trials were at low risk of bias for sequence
               generation, 60\% for attrition bias for falls (66/110), 73\% for
               attrition bias for fallers (96/131), and only 38\% (60/159) for
               allocation concealment. Multiple-component group exercise
               significantly reduced rate of falls (RaR 0.71, 95\% CI 0.63 to
               0.82; 16 trials; 3622 participants) and risk of falling (RR
               0.85, 95\% CI 0.76 to 0.96; 22 trials; 5333 participants), as
               did multiple-component home-based exercise (RaR 0.68, 95\% CI
               0.58 to 0.80; 7 trials; 951 participants and RR 0.78, 95\% CI
               0.64 to 0.94; 6 trials; 714 participants). For Tai Chi, the
               reduction in rate of falls bordered on statistical significance
               (RaR 0.72, 95\% CI 0.52 to 1.00; 5 trials; 1563 participants)
               but Tai Chi did significantly reduce risk of falling (RR 0.71,
               95\% CI 0.57 to 0.87; 6 trials; 1625 participants). Overall,
               exercise interventions significantly reduced the risk of
               sustaining a fall-related fracture (RR 0.34, 95\% CI 0.18 to
               0.63; 6 trials; 810 participants). Multifactorial interventions,
               which include individual risk assessment, reduced rate of falls
               (RaR 0.76, 95\% CI 0.67 to 0.86; 19 trials; 9503 participants),
               but not risk of falling (RR 0.93, 95\% CI 0.86 to 1.02; 34
               trials; 13,617 participants). Overall, vitamin D did not reduce
               rate of falls (RaR 1.00, 95\% CI 0.90 to 1.11; 7 trials; 9324
               participants) or risk of falling (RR 0.96, 95\% CI 0.89 to 1.03;
               13 trials; 26,747 participants), but may do so in people with
               lower vitamin D levels before treatment. Home safety assessment
               and modification interventions were effective in reducing rate
               of falls (RaR 0.81, 95\% CI 0.68 to 0.97; 6 trials; 4208
               participants) and risk of falling (RR 0.88, 95\% CI 0.80 to
               0.96; 7 trials; 4051 participants). These interventions were
               more effective in people at higher risk of falling, including
               those with severe visual impairment. Home safety interventions
               appear to be more effective when delivered by an occupational
               therapist. An intervention to treat vision problems (616
               participants) resulted in a significant increase in the rate of
               falls (RaR 1.57, 95\% CI 1.19 to 2.06) and risk of falling (RR
               1.54, 95\% CI 1.24 to 1.91). When regular wearers of multifocal
               glasses (597 participants) were given single lens glasses, all
               falls and outside falls were significantly reduced in the
               subgroup that regularly took part in outside activities.
               Conversely, there was a significant increase in outside falls in
               intervention group participants who took part in little outside
               activity. Pacemakers reduced rate of falls in people with
               carotid sinus hypersensitivity (RaR 0.73, 95\% CI 0.57 to 0.93;
               3 trials; 349 participants) but not risk of falling. First eye
               cataract surgery in women reduced rate of falls (RaR 0.66, 95\%
               CI 0.45 to 0.95; 1 trial; 306 participants), but second eye
               cataract surgery did not. Gradual withdrawal of psychotropic
               medication reduced rate of falls (RaR 0.34, 95\% CI 0.16 to
               0.73; 1 trial; 93 participants), but not risk of falling. A
               prescribing modification programme for primary care physicians
               significantly reduced risk of falling (RR 0.61, 95\% CI 0.41 to
               0.91; 1 trial; 659 participants). An anti-slip shoe device
               reduced rate of falls in icy conditions (RaR 0.42, 95\% CI 0.22
               to 0.78; 1 trial; 109 participants). One trial (305
               participants) comparing multifaceted podiatry including foot and
               ankle exercises with standard podiatry in people with disabling
               foot pain significantly reduced the rate of falls (RaR 0.64,
               95\% CI 0.45 to 0.91) but not the risk of falling. There is no
               evidence of effect for cognitive behavioural interventions on
               rate of falls (RaR 1.00, 95\% CI 0.37 to 2.72; 1 trial; 120
               participants) or risk of falling (RR 1.11, 95\% CI 0.80 to 1.54;
               2 trials; 350 participants). Trials testing interventions to
               increase knowledge/educate about fall prevention alone did not
               significantly reduce the rate of falls (RaR 0.33, 95\% CI 0.09
               to 1.20; 1 trial; 45 participants) or risk of falling (RR 0.88,
               95\% CI 0.75 to 1.03; 4 trials; 2555 participants). Thirteen
               trials provided a comprehensive economic evaluation. Three of
               these indicated cost savings for their interventions during the
               trial period: home-based exercise in over 80-year-olds, home
               safety assessment and modification in those with a previous
               fall, and one multifactorial programme targeting eight specific
               risk factors. Authors' conclusionsAuthors' conclusions Group and
               home-based exercise programmes, and home safety interventions
               reduce rate of falls and risk of falling. Multifactorial
               assessment and intervention programmes reduce rate of falls but
               not risk of falling; Tai Chi reduces risk of falling. Overall,
               vitamin D supplementation does not appear to reduce falls but
               may be effective in people who have lower vitamin D levels
               before treatment.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), with
              limited number of beds and resource-intensive services, is a key
              component of patient flow. Because the PICU is a crossroads for
              many patients, transfer or discharge delays can negatively impact
              a patient's clinical status and efficiency. OBJECTIVE: The
              objective of this study was to describe, using direct
              observation, PICU bed utilization. METHODS: We conducted a
              real-time, prospective observational study in a convenience
              sample of days in the PICU of an urban, tertiary-care children's
              hospital. RESULTS: Among 824 observed hours, 19,887 bed-hours
              were recorded, with 82\% being for critical care services and
              18\% for non--critical care services. Fourteen activities
              accounted for 95\% of bed-hours. Among 200 hours when the PICU
              was at full capacity, 75\% of the time included at least 1 bed
              that was used for non--critical care services; 37\% of the time
              at least 2 beds. The mean waiting time for a floor bed assignment
              was 9 hours (median, 5.5 hours) and accounted for 4.62\% of all
              bed-hours observed. CONCLUSIONS: The PICU delivered critical care
              services most of the time, but periods of non--critical care
              services represented a significant amount of time. In particular,
              periods with no bed available for new patients were associated
              with at least 1 or more PICU beds being used for non--critical
              care activities. The method should be reproducible in other
              settings to learn more about the structure and processes of care
              and patient flow and to make improvements. Journal of Hospital

              emerged for the integration of electronic health records (EHRs)
              into the U.S. health care system. A consensus conference in
              October 2009 met to discuss the future research agenda with
              regard to using information technology (IT) to improve the future
              quality and safety of emergency department (ED) care. The
              literature is mixed as to how the use of computerized provider
              order entry (CPOE), clinical decision support (CDS), EHRs, and
              patient tracking systems has improved or degraded the safety and
              quality of ED care. Such mixed findings must be considered in the
              national push for rapid implementation of health IT. We present a
              research agenda addressing the major questions that are posed by
              the introduction of IT into ED care; these questions relate to
              interoperability, patient flow and integration into clinical

  abstract = "Background:Intermountain Healthcare (Salt Lake City), in
              conjunction with emergency department (ED) staff at LDS Hospital,
              designed an integrated patient tracking system (PTS) and a
              specialized data repository (ED Data Mart) that was part of an
              overall enterprisewide data warehouse. After two years of
              internal beta testing the PTS and its associated data captures,
              an analysis of various ED operations by time of day was
              undertaken.Methods: Real-time data, concurrent with individual ED
              patient encounters from July 1, 2004 through June 30, 2005 were
              included in a retrospective analysis.Results: A number of
              patterns were revealed that provide a starting point for
              understanding ED processes and flow. In particular, ED census,
              acuity, operations, and throughput vary with the time of day. For
              example, patients seen during low-census times, in the middle of
              the night, appear to have a higher acuity. Radiology and
              laboratory utilization were highly correlated with ED arrivals,
              and the higher the acuity, the greater the
              utilization.Discussion: Although it is unclear whether or not

              of patients during the perioperative process. We present data on
              all patients undergoing ambulatory surgery. Patients' progress
              during their surgical stay was recorded at 17 strategic events
              using this real-time patient tracking technology. These times
              were used to identify inefficiencies in the perioperative process
              by identifying bottlenecks and areas of high variation. We found
              that both raw and actual operating room (OR) utilization
              efficiency was less than 50\%. Points of high variation in a
              patient's progress occurred during the time from admit to the
              hospital until the patient was ready for the OR; the time from
              when a patient was ready for the OR until they were called for;
              and the time a patient spends in the OR preoperative holding
              room. Causes for variation were identified and, traced back to
              individual procedures, activities, and work processes.
              Multidisciplinary improvement teams were created to improve the
              pinpointed problem areas. The real-time patient routing system is
              a process that has proven to be highly valuable to all

              stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Apixaban is
              partially renally excreted and may accumulate in patients with
              renal impairment. METHODS: We evaluated the efficacy and safety
              of apixaban 5 mg twice daily (2.5 mg twice daily in selected
              patients) compared with aspirin 81 to 324 mg daily in 1697
              patients with stage III chronic kidney disease (CKD) enrolled in
              the Apixaban Versus Acetylsalicylic Acid to Prevent Stroke in
              Atrial Fibrillation Patients Who Have Failed or are Unsuitable
              for Vitamin K Antagonist Treatment (AVERROES) trial. Primary
              outcome was all stroke and non-central nervous system emboli.
              RESULTS: Compared with patients with estimated glomerular
              filtration rates (eGFRs) $\geq$60 mL/min per 1.73 m2, stage III
              CKD patients (n = 1697; 30\% of the cohort; mean eGFR 49 mL/min
              per 1.73 m2) were older (mean age 75 v 68 years) with more
              frequent hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, and previous
              stroke (all P < .01). Stage III CKD was an independent predictor
              of primary events (hazard ratio [HR] 1.6; P = .01) and major
              hemorrhage (HR 2.2; P = .02). Apixaban significantly reduced
              primary events by 68\% (5.6\% per year on aspirin v 1.8\% per
              year on apixaban; HR 0.32; 95\% confidence interval [CI]
              0.18-0.55; P < .001) for stage III CKD participants and by 43\%
              (2.8\% per year on aspirin v 1.6\% per year on apixaban; HR 0.57;
              95\% CI 0.37-0.87; P = .009) for patients with eGFRs $\geq$60
              mL/min per 1.73 m2 (P for interaction = .10). There was no
              significant difference in major hemorrhage in stage III CKD
              patients by treatment: 2.2\% per year with aspirin versus 2.5\%
              per year with apixaban (HR 1.2; 95\% CI 0.65-2.1). CONCLUSIONS:
              Stage III CKD was an independent predictor of stroke in atrial
              fibrillation patients taking aspirin. Among stage III CKD
              patients, apixaban significantly reduced stroke relative to

              way we work has changed very little over the past decades. We

              protection. The precision of our procedures is limited by the
              distance from the fluoroscopic images and, furthermore, patients

              physician standing at the table for prolonged periods while

               adults requiring general anaesthesia reduces risks of
               complications and failure compared with direct laryngoscopy. Our
               secondary aim was to assess the benefits and risks of these
               devices in selected population groups, such as adults with
               obesity and those with a known or predicted difficult airway.
               Search methods Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central
               Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and Embase on
               10 February 2015. Our search terms were relevant to the review
               question and were not limited by outcomes. We carried out
               clinical trials register searches and forward and backward
               citation tracking. We reran the search on 12 January 2016; we
               added potential new studies of interest from the 2016 search to
               a list of 'Studies awaiting classification', and we will
               incorporate these studies into the formal review during the
               review update. Selection criteria Selection criteria We
               considered all randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized
               studies with adult patients undergoing laryngoscopy performed
               with a VLS or a Macintosh laryngoscope in a clinical, emergency
               or out-of-hospital setting. We included parallel and cross-over
               study designs. Data collection and analysis Data collection and
               analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial quality
               and extracted data, consulting a third review author to resolve
               disagreements. We used standard Cochrane methodological
               procedures, including assessment of risk of bias. Main results
               Main results We included 64 studies identified during the 2015
               search that enrolled 7044 adult participants and compared a VLS
               of one or more designs with a Macintosh laryngoscope. We
               identified 38 studies awaiting classification and seven ongoing
               studies. Of the 64 included studies, 61 included elective
               surgical patients, and three were conducted in an emergency
               setting. Among 48 studies that included participants without a
               predicted difficult airway, 15 used techniques to simulate a
               difficult airway. Seven recruited participants with a known or
               predicted difficult airway, and the remaining studies did not
               specify or included both predicted and not predicted difficult
               airways. Only two studies specifically recruited obese
               participants. It was not possible to blind the intubator to the
               device, and we noted a high level of inevitable heterogeneity,
               given the large number of studies. Statistically significantly
               fewer failed intubations were reported when a VLS was used
               (Mantel-Haenszel (M-H) odds ratio (OR), random-effects 0.35,
               95\% confidence Interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.65; 38 studies; 4127
               participants), and fewer failed intubations occurred when a VLS
               was used in participants with an anticipated difficult airway
               (M-H OR, random-effects 0.28, 95\% CI 0.15 to 0.55; six studies;
               830 participants). We graded the quality of this evidence as
               moderate on the basis of the GRADE system. Failed intubations
               were fewer when a VLS was used in participants with a simulated
               difficult airway (M-H OR, random-effects 0.18, 95\% CI 0.04 to
               0.77; nine studies; 810 participants), but groups with no
               predicted difficult airway provided no significant results (M-H
               OR, random-effects 0.61, 95\% CI 0.22 to 1.67; 19 studies; 1743
               participants). Eight studies reported on hypoxia, and only three
               of these described any events; results showed no differences
               between devices for this outcome (M-H OR, random-effects 0.39,
               95\% CI 0.10 to 1.44; 1319 participants). Similarly, few studies
               reported on mortality, noting no differences between devices
               (M-H OR, fixed-effect 1.09, 95\% CI 0.65 to 1.82; two studies;
               663 participants), and only one study reporting on the
               occurrence of respiratory complications (78 participants); we
               graded these three outcomes as very low quality owing to lack of
               data. We found no statistically significant differences between
               devices in the proportion of successful first attempts (M-H OR,
               random-effects 1.27, 95\% CI 0.77 to 2.09; 36 studies; 4731
               participants) nor in those needing more than one attempt. We
               graded the quality of this evidence as moderate. Studies
               reported no statistically significant differences in the
               incidence of sore throat in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU)
               (M-H OR, random-effects 1.00 (95\% CI 0.73 to 1.38); 10 studies;
               1548 participants) nor at 24 hours postoperatively (M-H OR
               random-effects 0.54, 95\% CI 0.27 to 1.07; eight studies; 844
               participants); we graded the quality of this evidence as
               moderate. Data combined to include studies of cross-over design
               revealed statistically significantly fewer laryngeal or airway
               traumas (M-H OR, random-effects 0.68, 95\% CI 0.48 to 0.96; 29
               studies; 3110 participants) and fewer incidences of
               postoperative hoarseness (M-H OR, fixed-effect 0.57, 95\% CI
               0.36 to 0.88; six studies; 527 participants) when a VLS was
               used. A greater number of laryngoscopies performed with a VLS
               achieved a view of most of the glottis (M-H OR, random-effects
               6.77, 95\% CI 4.17 to 10.98; 22 studies; 2240 participants),
               fewer laryngoscopies performed with a VLS achieved no view of
               the glottis (M-H OR, random-effects 0.18, 95\% CI 0.13 to 0.27;
               22 studies; 2240 participants) and the VLS was easier to use
               (M-H OR, random-effects 7.13, 95\% CI 3.12 to 16.31; seven
               studies; 568 participants). Although a large number of studies
               reported time required for tracheal intubation (55 studies; 6249
               participants), we did not present an effects estimate for this
               outcome owing to the extremely high level of statistical
               heterogeneity (I2 = 96\%). Authors' conclusions Authors'
               conclusions Videolaryngoscopes may reduce the number of failed
               intubations, particularly among patients presenting with a
               difficult airway. They improve the glottic view and may reduce
               laryngeal/airway trauma. Currently, no evidence indicates that
               use of a VLS reduces the number of intubation attempts or the
               incidence of hypoxia or respiratory complications, and no
               evidence indicates that use of a VLS affects time required for
               intubation.",

  abstract = "Background A new disposable flexible videoscope, the
              Ambu\textregistered{} aScope, has several potential advantages
              compared with reusable devices, but it is a prerequisite for its
              widespread use that it functions sufficiently well in the
              management of patients in whom difficulty with airway management
              is anticipated and awake intubation is indicated. Methods In a
              pilot study, 20 patients with normal airways were intubated with
              the aScope. Subsequently, 40 patients with predicted difficult
              tracheal intubation were randomly assigned to be intubated awake
              with either the aScope or the reusable Olympus BF
              videobronchoscope. Results All patients were successfully
              intubated awake. The median total intubation time, including the
              administration of local anaesthesia, was 278 vs. 234 s in the
              aScope and Olympus groups, respectively (P = 0.03). In two cases
              in the aScope group, the image became blurred immediately after
              the first injection of lidocaine via the injection channel, and
              the time that it took to replace the scopes was included in the
              intubation times. Conclusion Both the disposable aScope and the
              reusable Olympus videoscope allowed safe awake intubation in our
              elective patients with severely difficult, but uncompromised,
              airways. The occasional need to employ a spare scope because of

              (Ambu\textregistered{} aScope™) fibrescopes, at the Queens

              March 2014. The total annual cost of fibreoptic intubation with
              re-usable fibrescopes was \pounds{}46 385. Based on 141
              fibreoptic intubations per year, this equated to \pounds{}329 per
              use, an average dominated by repair/maintenance costs (43\%) and

              annual cost of using single-use fibrescopes for the same work
              would have been around \pounds{}200 per use. The analysis enabled

              the relationship between total cost of use vs number of uses for
              a fibrescope. An `isopleth' was identified for this relationship:
              a line that joined all the points where the cost of re-usable vs
              single-use fibrescopes was equal. It appears cheaper to use
              single-use fibrescopes at up to 200 fibreoptic intubations per
              year (a range commensurate with normal practice) even when the
              repair rate for re-usable fibrescopes is low. Any centre, knowing
              its fibrescope use and repair rate, can plot its data similarly

              drawbacks. First, answers to some of the questions, particularly
              those pertaining to complication rates, rely on the memory of
              participants. Second, the wording of certain questions may have
              imparted different meanings. Third, the format of the
              questionnaire may have confused some. Fourth, one cannot expect
              that all questionnaires will be answered fully. Fifth, as
              indicated by several respondents, several important topics (eg,
              topical anesthetic agents and mode of their delivery, prophylaxis

  abstract = "Background and objective: In order to obtain information on the
              clinical application of bronchoscopy in Japan, the Japan Society
              for Respiratory Endoscopy (JSRE) conducted a postal survey.
              Methods: A questionnaire was sent to 526 authorized institutes of
              the JSRE. The subject was bronchoscopy procedures performed
              during 2006. Results: The response rate was 71.3\%. The total
              number of bronchoscopies performed was 74 770. Of these, 74 412
              were flexible bronchoscopies and 358 were rigid bronchoscopies.
              At least one JSRE-authorized specialist had worked with 97\% of
              respondents. Eighty-five per cent of respondents performed
              bronchoscopy under topical anaesthesia for almost all patients.
              Seventy-five per cent of respondents routinely used the oral
              route. The reported numbers of diagnostic bronchoscopies was 12
              509 for simple bronchoscopy, 25 971 for forceps biopsy, 26 289
              for brush biopsy, 25 659 for bronchial washing, 1387 for
              transbronchial needle aspiration and 6716 for BAL. Three deaths
              were caused by forceps biopsy (0.012\%). The morbidity rates for
              these diagnostic procedures ranged from 0.14\% to 2.5\%. The
              reported numbers of therapeutic bronchoscopies was 476 for
              tracheobronchial stent, 164 for neodymium (Nd): yttrium-aluminium
              garnet (YAG) laser photoresection (LPR), 40 for photodynamic
              therapy, 81 for balloon dilatation, 145 for endobronchial
              electrocautery, 120 for argon plasma coagulation, 109 for
              microwave coagulation (MWC), 116 for ethanol injection, 110 for
              foreign body removal and 89 for bronchial occlusion. Deaths
              occurred only as a consequence of Nd : YAG LPR (0.61\%). The
              morbidity rates for these therapeutic procedures ranged from 0\%
              to 5\%. Conclusions: The preparation for, and practice of,
              bronchoscopy varied greatly between respondents. Diagnostic
              bronchoscopy was well tolerated and safe. Therapeutic procedures
              did not appear to be practised widely or frequently.",

              this technique. METHODS: A questionnaire survey about procedures
              carried out during the whole of the year 2010 was mailed to 538
              facilities accredited by the society. RESULTS: Responses were
              obtained from 511 facilities (95.0\%). Rigid bronchoscopes were
              used in only 18.5\% of the facilities, while mobile/thin
              bronchoscopes were used in $\geq$ 50\%, and fluoroscopy systems
              were used in 99.8\%. Biopsies were performed after
              discontinuation of therapy in patients receiving antiplatelet
              drugs and anticoagulants in 96.7\% and 97.4\% of the facilities,
              respectively. Atropine was administered for premedication in
              67.5\% of the facilities, a decrease from previous surveys.
              Intravenous sedation was given in 36.1\% of the facilities. In
              21.9\% of these, the procedure was conducted in the outpatient
              clinic for $\geq$ 70\% of patients. A bronchoscope was orally
              inserted in $\geq$ 70\% of patients in 95.7\% of the facilities.
              Intravenous access was maintained during the examination in
              92.5\% of the facilities, oxygen saturation was monitored during
              examinations in 99.0\%, oxygen was administered in 97.6\% and
              resuscitation equipment was available in 96\%. In 98.6\% of the
              facilities, bronchoscopes were disinfected using an automatic
              washing machine, with glutaraldehyde used in 42.2\%. CONCLUSIONS:
              Japan-specific characteristics of bronchoscopic practice were
              identified. Whether procedures used in Japan meet international
              guidelines with respect to safety should be monitored
              continuously. In addition, a Japanese evidence-based consensus is

  title    = "A North American Survey of Respiratory Therapist and Physician
              Tracheostomy Decannulation Practices",
  author   = "Stelfox, Henry Thomas and Hess, Dean R and Schmidt, Ulrich H",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Tracheostomy is a common surgical procedure performed
              on critically ill patients. However, little is known about how
              clinicians make decisions to decannulate patients, and whether
              similar decisions are made by respiratory therapists (RTs) and
              physicians. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional survey of RTs
              (n = 52) and physicians (n = 102) at 54 medical centers in North
              America, to characterize contemporary decannulation practices.
              RESULTS: RTs and physicians rated ability to tolerate capping,
              secretions, cough effectiveness, and level of consciousness as
              the most important factors in the decannulation decision, with
              RTs placing greater emphasis on ability to tolerate capping and
              physicians on level of consciousness. In the clinical scenarios,
              RTs and physicians recommended decannulation with similar
              frequency (52\% vs 55\%, P = .54). Patients were most likely to
              be recommended for decannulation if they had a strong cough,
              scant thin secretions, required minimal supplemental oxygen, and
              were alert and interactive. In addition, RTs were more likely to
              recommend decannulation for patients who demonstrated an ability
              to tolerate tracheostomy tube capping for 72 hours and whose
              etiology of respiratory failure was chronic obstructive pulmonary
              disease. RTs preferred shorter time frames for defining
              decannulation failure than did physicians (median response 48 h
              vs 96 h, P = .02 for test of proportions). Both groups identified
              2-5\% (median response) as an acceptable rate of decannulation
              failure (P = .48 for test of proportions). CONCLUSIONS: Important
              differences exist in the decannulation practices of North
              American RTs and physicians. Evidence-based tracheostomy
              guidelines are needed to facilitate the safe and effective
              management of patients with tracheostomies.",

              intubation and ``cannot intubate, cannot ventilate'' (CICV)
              situations.MethodsA questionnaire was e-mailed to members of the
              Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society to ascertain their
              preferences, experience, and comfort level with regard to their
              use of airway equipment in difficult intubation and CICV
              situations in adult patients. A Chi square test was used to
              analyse the data. All reported P values are two-sided.ResultsNine
              hundred ninety-seven of 2,532 questionnaires (39\%) were
              returned. In an unanticipated difficult direct laryngoscopic
              intubation situation, 893 of 997 (90\%) respondents chose a video
              laryngoscope as the first-choice rescue technique, while 41 (4\%)
              and 21 (2\%) of respondents chose a flexible bronchoscope and an
              intubating laryngeal mask airway device, respectively. The
              majority of anesthesiologists had experience and were comfortable
              with using a flexible bronchoscope or a video laryngoscope.
              Regarding CICV, 294 of 955 (31\%) respondents stated that they
              had never encountered it. Wire-guided cricothyroidotomy was
              chosen as the first-choice surgical airway by 375 of 955 (39\%)
              respondents, while intravenous catheter cricothyroidotomy and
              ``defer to tracheostomy by surgeon'' were selected by 266 (28\%)
              and 215 (23\%) respondents, respectively. Seven hundred
              eighty-five of 997 (78\%) respondents were familiar with the
              exact steps of the American Society of Anesthesiologists'
              difficult airway algorithm, while 448 (47\%) had attended an
              airway workshop within the past five years.ConclusionsIn a
              difficult intubation situation, the most frequently selected
              first-choice airway device was a video laryngoscope, followed by
              a flexible bronchoscope. In a CICV situation, the most frequently
              selected first-choice surgical airway technique was a wire-guided
              cricothyroidotomy, followed by an intravenous catheter

  abstract = "Background: Several factors may delay tracheostomy. As many
              critically ill patients either suffer from coagulation
              abnormalities or are being treated with anticoagulants, fear of
              bleeding complications during the procedure may also delay
              tracheostomy. It is unknown whether such (usually mild)
              coagulation abnormalities are corrected first and to what extent.
              The purpose of this study was to ascertain current practice of
              tracheostomy in the Netherlands with regard to timing,
              pre-operative correction of coagulation disorders and
              peri-/intra-operative measures. Methods: In October 2005, a
              questionnaire was sent to the medical directors of all
              non-pediatric ICUs with $\geq$5 beds suitable for mechanical
              ventilation in the Netherlands. Results: A response was obtained
              from 44 (64\%) out of 69 ICUs included in the survey.
              Seventy-five percent of patients receive tracheostomy within 2
              days after the decision to proceed with a tracheostomy. Reasons
              indicated as frequent causes for delay were most often logistical
              factors. A heterogeneous attitude exists regarding values of
              coagulation parameters acceptable to perform tracheostomy. Fifty
              percent of the respondents have no guideline on correction of
              coagulation disorders or anticoagulant therapy before
              tracheostomy. Antimicrobial prophylaxis is almost never
              administered before tracheostomy. Forty-eight percent mentioned
              always using endoscopic guidance and 66\% of ICUs only perform
              chest radiography on indication. Conclusions: There is a high
              variation in peri- and intra-operative practice of tracheostomy
              in the Netherlands. Especially on the subject of coagulation and
              tracheostomy there are different opinions and protocols are often

              tracheostomy and its variation between different intensive care
              units (ICUs) in Switzerland. Design: Retrospective, descriptive
              prevalence study. Setting: A questionnaire was sent to all
              intensive care units formally recognized by the Swiss Society of
              Intensive Care Medicine. Excluded were paediatric ICUs. A total
              of 48 ICUs (70\%) responded. Patients: In 1995 and 1996 the
              participating units had admitted 90,412 patients for a total of
              243,921 ICU days. Results: Seventy percent of the contacted ICUs
              answered the questionnaire. The prevalence of tracheostomy was
              10\% in the long-term ventilated patients (defined as >24 h), or
              1.3\% of all patients. Most tracheostomies were performed during
              the 2nd week of ventilation. The frequency of tracheostomy varied
              widely (0--60\%) and was only slightly associated with the
              different language regions of our country and with the policy of
              hospitals to accept or refuse intubated patients on their normal
              wards. Most units offered either conventional surgical
              tracheostomy (69\%) and/or percutaneous procedures (57\%). The
              decision to perform a tracheostomy was made mostly by the
              intensivist and the procedure was more often performed in the ICU
              (65\%) than in the operating theatre (35\%). Units where the
              intensivist had exclusive control used only percutaneous
              techniques. An overall complication rate of 13\% was reported,
              bleeding and infections being at the top of the scale. Only 27\%
              of the units performed late follow-up protocols. Conclusions:
              Despite its frequency, tracheostomy in Swiss ICUs is far from
              being standardized with regard to indication, timing and choice
              of technique.",

              in ICU but patient follow-up and management after ICU has been
              poorly documented. We conducted a practice survey in French
              general ICUs and in neurointensive care units concerning
              tracheostomized ICU patients and their management after ICU.
              Study design National observational descriptive transversal study
              as survey of opinion and practices. Materials and methods An
              email, with a link to an automated online questionnaire, was sent
              to two medical doctors of each French ICU. Demographic data and
              reported practices concerning indications, technique and post-ICU
              management were collected. Results We received 148 intensivists
              responses from different ICUs, of which 15\% from
              neurointensivists. There was no difference between general
              intensivists and neurointensivists concerning the reported use of
              tracheostomy (10 $\pm$ 13\% vs 20 $\pm$ 22\%, P = 0.05) and
              concerning the usual timing of the procedure (predominantly
              between the 10th and the 21th day) (P = 0.62). Indications were
              weaning failure from the ventilator and neurological ventilatory
              dysfunction. Percutaneous tracheostomy was mainly performed
              irrespective of the type of unit. Only 48\% of doctors declared
              usually be able to wean patient from the cannula before ICU
              discharge. Usual difficulties for post-ICU transfer due only to
              the presence of the cannula were found by 80\% of respondants.
              Eighty-nine per cent of respondents felt that management of
              tracheostomized patients after the ICU could be improved.
              Conclusion Tracheostomy is a frequent procedure, mostly
              percutaneous. Indications and timing for tracheostomy correspond
              to the recommendations. Reported difficulties in post-ICU
              management are important and present nationwide.",

              Anaesthetist physicians, each referent for one of the French
              centres practicing thoracic surgery, during year 2012. Methods
              Electronic questionnaire about the activity of the centre in
              thoracic surgery, and modalities and estimated frequencies of
              different analgesic techniques. Primary assessment was the
              estimated percentage of acts, after imputation from original
              data. Results Eighty-four centres out of 103 (82 \%) answered the
              questionnaire. Coupling locoregional to general anaesthesia
              involved 74 \% of thoracotomies and 35 \% of thoracoscopies. A
              practice (i.e. for more than 5 \% of patients) of epidural
              analgesia was declared by 68 centres (81 \%), and by 27 centres
              (32 \%) for paravertebral block. The most current practices for
              epidural analgesia were: thoracic puncture, intraoperative
              initiation, ropivaca{\"\i}ne 0.2 \% plus sufentanil,
              patient-controlled administration with infusion plus bolus,
              application more than 48 hrs post surgery. The practice rates for
              technique of paravertebral block were: Eason \& Wyatt 34 \%,
              ultrasound-guided 24 \%, internal 42 \%. The most frequent
              systemic analgesia was patient-controlled intravenous morphine.
              Ketamine was used in 60 \% of the cases. Conclusions French
              practice of analgesia after thoracic surgery improved quality
              during the last decade, but more than one patient on four
              (compared to 8 \% in UK) may have neither epidural nor
              paravertebral block, while such techniques are nowadays

              We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the
              accuracy of TBNA in the diagnosis of PPLs, comparing its
              diagnostic yield with transbronchial biopsy (TBB) and assessing
              the main predictors of a successful aspirate. In 18 studies, the
              overall TBNA yield was 0.53 (95\% CI 0.44--0.61). TBNA showed a
              higher accuracy when directly compared to TBB (0.60 (95\% CI
              0.49--0.71) versus 0.45 (95\% CI 0.37--0.54)). The subgroup
              analyses documented a higher TBNA yield when the computed

              worsening angina to class III despite maximal medical therapy. He
              was referred for myocardial perfusion imaging, which showed a
              large area of inferior ischemia. Subsequent coronary angiography
              revealed a chronic total occlusion (CTO) of the right coronary
              artery with brisk collateral flow from the left anterior
              descending artery (Figure 1). There was minimal obstructive
              disease in the remainder of the coronary tree. An attempt at
              percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was unsuccessful. He was
              treated with continuation of his medical therapy, although he
              remained with lifestyle-limiting class II to III angina. Figure

              expected course of the distal vessel outlined in red and the
              total occlusion shown by the arrow. Right, Collateralization of
              the right coronary artery from the left anterior descending (LAD)
              artery with arrows pointing to the posterior descending artery
              (PDA) and posterolateral ventricular (PLV) branches of the right
              coronary artery. The septal collaterals from the LAD to RCA are
              highlighted. Coronary CTO is characterized by heavy
              atherosclerotic plaque burden within the artery, resulting in
              complete (or nearly complete) occlusion of the vessel. Although
              the duration of the occlusion is difficult to determine on
              clinical grounds, a total occlusion must be present for at least
              3 months to be considered a true CTO.1 Patients with CTO
              typically have collateralization of the distal vessel on coronary
              angiography, but these collaterals may not provide sufficient
              blood flow to the myocardial bed, resulting in ischemia and
              anginal symptoms. CTO is clinically distinct from acute coronary
              occlusion, which occurs in the setting of ST-segment--elevation
              myocardial infarction, or subacute coronary occlusion, discovered

              provide important qualitative and quantitative information
              regarding mitral regurgitation. Contemporary planning of surgical
              mitral valve repair, however, still relies heavily upon
              subjective predictions based on experience and intuition. While
              patient-specific mitral valve modeling holds promise, its
              effectiveness is limited by assumptions that must be made about
              constitutive material properties. In this paper, we propose and
              develop a semi-automated framework that combines machine learning
              image analysis with geometrical and biomechanical models to build
              a patient-specific mitral valve representation that incorporates
              image-derived material properties. We use our computational
              framework, along with 3D TEE images of the open and closed mitral
              valve, to estimate values for chordae rest lengths and leaflet
              material properties. These parameters are initialized using
              generic values and optimized to match the visualized deformation
              of mitral valve geometry between the open and closed states.
              Optimization is achieved by minimizing the summed Euclidean
              distances between the estimated and image-derived closed mitral
              valve geometry. The spatially varying material parameters of the
              mitral leaflets are estimated using an extended Kalman filter to
              take advantage of the temporal information available from TEE.
              This semi-automated and patient-specific modeling framework was
              tested on 15 TEE image acquisitions from 14 patients. Simulated
              mitral valve closures yielded average errors (measured by
              point-to-point Euclidean distances) of 1.86 $\pm$ 1.24 mm. The
              estimated material parameters suggest that the anterior leaflet
              is stiffer than the posterior leaflet and that these properties
              vary between individuals, consistent with experimental

              proposed to study the biomechanical impact of MV repair, but
              their translation into the clinics remains challenging. As a step
              towards this goal, we present an integrated framework for
              finite-element modeling of the MV closure based on
              patient-specific anatomies and boundary conditions. Starting from
              temporal medical images, we estimate a comprehensive model of the
              MV apparatus dynamics, including papillary tips, using a
              machine-learning approach. A detailed model of the open MV at
              end-diastole is then computed, which is finally closed according
              to a FEM of MV biomechanics. The motion of the mitral annulus and
              papillary tips are constrained from the image data for increased
              accuracy. A sensitivity analysis of our system shows that chordae
              rest length and boundary conditions have a significant influence
              upon the simulation results. We quantitatively test the
              generalization of our framework on 25 consecutive patients.
              Comparisons between the simulated closed valve and ground truth
              show encouraging results (average point-to-mesh distance: 1.49
              $\pm$ 0.62 mm) but also the need for personalization of tissue
              properties, as illustrated in three patients. Finally, the
              predictive power of our model is tested on one patient who
              underwent MitralClip by comparing the simulated intervention with
              the real outcome in terms of MV closure, yielding promising
              prediction. By providing an integrated way to perform MV

              was developed in this paper. This robot is mainly composed of a
              locomotion mechanism, a wireless power supply subsystem, and a
              communication subsystem. The locomotion mechanism is composed of
              three liner-driving cells connected with each other through a
              two-freedom universal joint. The wireless power supply subsystem
              is composed of a resonance transmit coil to transmit an
              alternating magnetic field, and a secondary coil to receive the
              power. Wireless communication system could transmit the image to
              the monitor, or send the control commands to the robot. The whole
              robot was packaged in the waterproof bellows. Activating the
              three driving cells under some rhythm, the robot could creep
              forward or backward as a worm. A mathematic model is built to
              express the energy coupling efficiency. Some experiments are
              performed to test the efficiency and the capability of energy

              a pig intestine were measured in in vitro experiments. The
              results demonstrated this robot can navigate the intestine

              communication remove the need of a connecting wire and improve

              mechanism and principle have a high reliability and a good
              adaptability to the in vitro intestine. This research has laid a

              extensive support personnel, their implementation has remained

              overcome several impediments of conventional laparoscopy in
              pediatric urology. However, in our practice we faced difficulties
              while performing specific tasks using the da Vinci Surgical
              System in small cavities. Thus, we objectively evaluated the
              performance of robot assisted laparoscopic skills in different
              sizes of workspace. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven assessors
              performed 5 different drills in 7 different sizes of cubic boxes
              (edge size ranging from 40 to 150 mm) with the da Vinci Surgical
              System. The drills were developed based on the McGill Inanimate
              System for Training and Evaluation of Laparoscopic Skills.
              Assessor performance was evaluated by 2 reviewers for the drill
              achievement, and time to completion was recorded. A global score
              was then calculated for each drill in accordance to 1 assessor
              and 1 box. RESULTS: There were significant collisions while
              working with the smaller cubes (edges measuring 40 and 45 mm),
              preventing the surgeon from performing drills. With difficulty,
              but without collision, the drills were performed in the 50 and 60
              mm size cubes. Drills could be accomplished uniformly with ease
              in the larger cubes (edge 70 mm and greater). CONCLUSIONS: We
              found that surgeon ability to perform tasks using the da Vinci
              Surgical System in a small workspace is restricted. This
              assessment was confirmed by a statistical analysis of the data
              collected, demonstrating that with common surgical practice using
              the da Vinci robot workspace has a major impact on surgeon
              performance.",

              surgeons overseeing their moves. Shademan et al. designed a
              ``Smart Tissue Autonomous Robot,'' or STAR, which consists of
              tools for suturing as well as fluorescent and 3D imaging, force
              sensing, and submillimeter positioning. With all of these
              components, the authors were able to use STAR for soft tissue
              surgery---a difficult task for a robot given tissue deformity and
              mobility. Surgeons tested STAR against manual surgery,
              laparoscopy, and robot-assisted surgery for porcine intestinal
              anastomosis, and found that the supervised autonomous surgery
              offered by the STAR system was superior. The current paradigm of
              robot-assisted surgeries (RASs) depends entirely on an individual
              surgeon's manual capability. Autonomous robotic
              surgery---removing the surgeon's hands---promises enhanced
              efficacy, safety, and improved access to optimized surgical
              techniques. Surgeries involving soft tissue have not been
              performed autonomously because of technological limitations,
              including lack of vision systems that can distinguish and track
              the target tissues in dynamic surgical environments and lack of
              intelligent algorithms that can execute complex surgical tasks.
              We demonstrate in vivo supervised autonomous soft tissue surgery
              in an open surgical setting, enabled by a plenoptic
              three-dimensional and near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) imaging
              system and an autonomous suturing algorithm. Inspired by the best
              human surgical practices, a computer program generates a plan to
              complete complex surgical tasks on deformable soft tissue, such
              as suturing and intestinal anastomosis. We compared metrics of
              anastomosis---including the consistency of suturing informed by
              the average suture spacing, the pressure at which the anastomosis
              leaked, the number of mistakes that required removing the needle
              from the tissue, completion time, and lumen reduction in
              intestinal anastomoses---between our supervised autonomous
              system, manual laparoscopic surgery, and clinically used RAS
              approaches. Despite dynamic scene changes and tissue movement
              during surgery, we demonstrate that the outcome of supervised
              autonomous procedures is superior to surgery performed by expert
              surgeons and RAS techniques in ex vivo porcine tissues and in
              living pigs. These results demonstrate the potential for
              autonomous robots to improve the efficacy, consistency,

              robotic-assisted platform for percutaneous coronary intervention
              is available for treating coronary artery disease. METHODS: In
              this prospective single-arm trial, patients with symptomatic
              peripheral artery disease (Rutherford class 2 to 5) affecting the
              femoropoplital artery were enrolled. Endpoints evaluated were: 1)
              device technical success, defined as successful cannulation of
              the target vessel with the robotic system; 2) device safety,
              defined as absence of device related serious adverse event
              (hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, life threatening, or
              resulted in death); and 3) clinical procedural success, defined

              (multiple use) flexible bronchoscopes have time and monetary
              costs associated with cleaning, and carries a small risk of cross
              infection. Single use bronchoscopes may provide an alternative,
              but have not been evaluated in this context. METHODS: Healthy
              volunteers underwent bronchoscopy at a day-case clinical research
              unit using the Ambu\textregistered{} aScope(TM) single-use
              flexible intubation bronchoscope. Broncho alveolar lavage was
              performed from a sub segmental bronchus within the right middle
              lobe; a total of 200 ml of warmed normal saline was instilled
              then aspirated using handheld suction. BAL volume yield, cell
              yield and viability were recorded. RESULTS: Ten volunteers, (mean
              age 23 years, six male) participated. Bronchoscopies were carried
              out by one of two senior bronchoscopists, experienced in the
              technique of obtaining BAL for research purposes. The results
              were compared to 50 (mean age 23, 14 male) procedures performed
              using the conventional scope by the same two bronchoscopists. The
              total volume yield was significantly higher in the disposable
              group median 152 ml (IQR 141-166 ml) as compared to conventional
              124 ml (110-135 ml), p = <0.01. The total cell yield and
              viability were similar in both groups, with no significant
              differences. CONCLUSIONS: With single use bronchoscopes, we
              achieved a larger BAL volume yield than conventional
              bronchoscopes, with comparable cell yield and viability. Better
              volume yields can potentially reduce post procedure side effects
              such as pleuritic chest pain and cough. The risk of cross
              infection can be eliminated, providing reassurance to researchers

               require policy-makers to make difficult decisions based on the
               potential benefits and costs of new healthcare interventions.
               The Canadian Partnership Against Cancer commissioned the
               development of the Cancer Risk Management Model as a tool to aid
               such decisions. This computer microsimulation model projects
               future population health and economic impacts of cancer control
               programs in Canada. Lung cancer was the first simulation module
               to be developed and was selected because of the magnitude of
               lung cancer burden in Canada and recent screening and treatment
               interventions that require policy decisions. Methods: The model
               simulates one individual life at a time, from birth to death,
               taking account of Canadian demographic and labor force
               characteristics, risk factor exposures and health histories, and
               then combines this information from all the simulated lives to
               produce aggregate measures of health outcomes for the Canadian
               population as a whole or for particular subpopulations. The
               direct costs of medical care can be estimated, as well as lost
               earnings and impacts on tax revenues. Results: The lung module

               website to registered users where structured scenarios can be
               explored for their projected impacts. Conclusion: The Cancer

               outcomes of radiofrequency ablation and limit recurrences of
               small renal tumors. Materials and Methods: The literature was
               searched via OvidSP MEDLINE from 1997 to current using MeSH
               terms. All levels of evidence and types of reports were
               reviewed. Results: We comprehensively reviewed technical issues,
               mechanisms, imaging criteria, ablative success, enhancement
               within one month, contraindications,oncological efficacy,
               morbidity rates, and follow-up strategies. Conclusion: The
               technique is safe and effective. Tumors < 2.5 cm are
               statistically most likely to remain disease-free. Anterior
               tumors are contraindicated. Strict follow-up is needed to detect
               failures, most of which occur within 3 months and can be easily
               salvaged with repeat radiofrequency ablation. Homogeneous
               enhancement within 1 month is not necessarily a failure, and
               tends to disappear after 4 to 6 weeks. Multi-disciplinary
               meetings must occur to discuss each case prior to treatment.

              remains of vital importance in optimizing and preserving
              fertility, as well as treating infertility. By definition,
              reproductive surgery employs microsurgical techniques with the
              objective of restoring natural fertility or enhancing assisted
              reproductive technologies. The avant-garde minimalist philosophy
              of this branch of gynecology has made it the natural trailblazer
              of laparoscopic surgery. Minimally invasive conservative
              treatment of uterine, tubal, ovarian and peritoneal pathology has
              long been the gold standard for women of reproductive age and
              those seeking fertility preservation. Robust surgical outcome
              data acknowledge clear advantages of advanced laparoscopic
              surgery over laparotomy. However, this comes at the cost of
              significant technical challenges. Computer-assisted laparoscopy,
              also known as robotic surgery, is posed to address the practical
              limitations of conventional laparoscopic surgery and bridge this
              technical gap. This enabling technology is a conceptual fusion of
              the practicality of conventional open surgery and the minimally
              invasive nature of laparoscopic surgery. With this comes the
              promise of simplifying complex minimally invasive

               molecular nanotechnology - an emerging field that has sparked
               increasing interest and controversy. This groundbreaking book
               describes fundamental physical principles, components and
               devices, then examines applications including computers of
               unprecedented power and manufacturing systems able to build such
               products molecule by molecule. Nanosystems presents a
               comprehensive overview of how molecular manufacturing will make
               products by using nanoscale (billionths of a meter) mechanical
               and robotic technologies to guide the placement of molecules and
               atoms. Working with these fundamental building blocks of matter
               will enable designers to approach the limits of the possible: to
               build the smallest devices, the fastest computers, the strongest
               materials, and the highest quality products. By manipulating
               common molecules at high frequency, molecular manufacturing will
               make these products quickly, inexpensively, and on a large
               scale. Molecular manufacturing is the key to implementing
               molecular nanotechnologies, building systems to complex atomic
               specifications. This landmark work first presents the basic
               principles of physics and chemistry required to understand
               molecular machines. Then, Dr. Drexler describes computational
               models of molecules as mechanical systems, the effects of
               statistical mechanics, quantum uncertainty, damage mechanisms,
               and energy dissipation, and the fundamentals of mechanosynthesis
               - the use of mechanical devices to guide molecular reactions.
               Nanosystems then applies the analytical tools and concepts
               developed in the first section to the design ofnanomechanical
               components, devices, and systems. It describes nanomechanical
               gears, bearings, motors, sensors, logic gates, submicron 1000
               MIPS computers (consuming 10(superscript -8) times as much power
               as comparable computers today), and systems able to join simple
               molecules to build complex products. The last section discusses
               how chemical, biochemical, and proximal probe technologies can
               be used to build complex molecular objects and how this
               capability can be used to implement molecular manufacturing.

              researchers are looking into transoral robotic surgery (TORS) as

              most significant advancement in minimally invasive surgery of
              this decade. One of the first surgical uses of the robot was in
              orthopaedics, neurosurgery, and cardiac surgery. However, it was
              the use in urology, and particularly in prostate surgery, that
              led to its widespread popularity. Robotic surgery, is also widely

               assembled from these components is one of the ultimate goals of
               bioinspired robotics. We constructed an amoeba-like molecular
               robot that can express continuous shape change in response to
               specific signal molecules. The robot is composed of a body, an
               actuator, and an actuator-controlling device (clutch). The body
               is a vesicle made from a lipid bilayer, and the actuator
               consists of proteins, kinesin, and microtubules. We made the
               clutch using designed DNA molecules. It transmits the force
               generated by the motor to the membrane, in response to a signal
               molecule composed of another sequence-designed DNA with chemical
               modifications. When the clutch was engaged, the robot exhibited
               continuous shape change. After the robot was illuminated with
               light to trigger the release of the signal molecule, the clutch
               was disengaged, and consequently, the shape-changing behavior
               was successfully terminated. In addition, the reverse
               process---that is, initiation of shape change by input of a
               signal---was also demonstrated. These results show that the
               components of the robot were consistently integrated into a
               functional system. We expect that this study can provide a
               platform to build increasingly complex and functional molecular
               systems with controllable motility. An amoeba-like molecular

              reimbursement decisions. The preferred measure of effectiveness
              is the quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained, where the
              quality of life adjustment is measured in terms of utility. Areas
              covered: We assessed the availability and variation of utility
              values for health states associated with advanced or metastatic
              non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to identify values appropriate
              for cost-effectiveness models assessing alternative treatments.
              Our systematic search of six electronic databases (January 2000
              to August 2015) found the current literature to be sparse in
              terms of utility values associated with NSCLC, identifying 27
              studies. Utility values were most frequently reported over time
              and by treatment type, and less frequently by disease response,
              stage of disease, adverse events or disease comorbidities. Expert
              commentary: In response to rising healthcare costs, payers
              increasingly consider the cost-effectiveness of novel treatments
              in reimbursement decisions, especially in oncology. As the number
              of therapies available to treat NSCLC increases,
              cost-effectiveness analyses will play a key role in reimbursement
              decisions in this area. Quantifying the relationship between
              health and quality of life for NSCLC patients via utility values
              is an important component of assessing the cost effectiveness of
              novel treatments.",

              retrospectively analyzed. Patients who underwent surgery for
              diagnosis and who were initiated with cancer treatment during the
              same hospital stay were excluded from study. Histological types
              and stages of lung cancer were determined. Expenses were grouped

              overnight room charges, medication costs, blood center costs,
              consumable expenditures' costs and inpatient service charges
              (including consultants' service, electrocardiogram, follow-up,
              nursing services, diagnostic interventions). Result: Of the 68
              patients, 55 (81\%) had non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 13
              (19\%) had small cell lung cancer (SCLC). 47\% of patients with
              NSCLC had stage 4 disease and 86\% of patients with SCLC had
              extensive stage disease. Median total cost per patient was 910
              (95\% CI= 832-1291) Euros (€). Of all costs, 37\% were due to
              inpatient service charges and 22\% were medication costs. Median
              total cost per patient was 912 (95\% CI= 783-1213) € in NSCLC
              patients and 908 (95\% CI= 456-2203) € in SCLC patients (p>
              0.05). In NSCLC group, total cost per patient was 873 (95\% CI=

              impetus to and foundation for the development of a new POpulation
              HEalth Model (POHEM) at Statistics Canada. Part of the impetus is
              statistical and derives from weaknesses in Canada's health
              statistics programme--particularly the lack of balance between
              information on health outcomes and health care resource
              consumption, and the absence of a coherent statistical structure.
              The other major impetus is the need for rational processes for
              managing and allocating resources to improve the health of
              Canadians. The foundation for the development of this model has
              come from the revolution in computing. Dramatic improvements have
              opened up new methodological opportunities, particularly
              sophisticated simulation modelling and detailed analyses of large
              volumes of microdata. POHEM is designed to build on these
              increasingly powerful methods in order to meet health statistical
              and policy needs. At this time, POHEM is like a
              partially-completed building. This article reviews its
              motivation, the overall architectural plan, and the portion of
              the structure already completed. A major portion of POHEM is

              disease in children, and lobectomy is traditionally considered as
              a first-line treatment. As the tumor is characterized by
              intraluminal growth, low malignancy and superficial infiltration
              of bronchial walls, bronchoscopic interventional therapy may
              provide an alternative treatment with favorable results. The aim
              of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
              bronchoscopic therapies for bronchial mucoepidermoid carcinoma in
              children. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Clinical manifestations,
              multiple bronchoscopic interventions and outcomes in 6 children
              with bronchial mucoepidermoid carcinoma were retrospectively
              analyzed. RESULTS: The median age was 8.7 years (range 4 to 12
              years). All the tumors were located in the lobar bronchus and
              were detected by computerized tomography. Diagnoses of low-grade
              mucoepidermoid carcinoma were made based on biopsies obtained via
              bronchoscopy. Five tumors were classified as intraluminal type
              and successfully eradicated by carbon dioxide cryotherapy and
              argon plasma coagulation under bronchoscopy. The other tumor in
              patient 3 was classified as the mixture type and could not be
              removed by a bronchoscopic, so left upper lobectomy was
              performed. For each patient, interventional procedures were
              conducted on the average for 6 times. No recurrence was detected
              by bronchoscopic inspections or computed tomography scans during
              follow-ups for 16-72 months. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple bronchoscopic
              procedures, as alternative treatments, are effective in removing

              diagnosed by pathology, and evaluated their clinical features,
              chest computer tomography findings and bronchoscopic
              manifestations. RESULTS: Two of the 8 pediatric patients had
              high-grade malignancies (lymphoma and sarcoma) and the others all
              had low-grade malignancies, including 2 cases with mucoepidermoid
              carcinoma and 4 cases with inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor.
              Their ages ranged from 4 to 8 years (mean, 5.7 $\pm$ 0.9). There
              were no specific clinical manifestations in the children, and all
              of them presented with various respiratory symptoms, including
              cough and gasping associated with hemoptysis. Chest CT indicated
              round intra-airway neoplasms. Obstructive pulmonary atelectasis
              occurred in the main bronchus of 4 patients (3 cases of the left
              main bronchus and 1 case of the right intermedius bronchus). All
              children (1 case with local anesthesia and 7 cases with general
              anesthesia) underwent interventional bronchoscopic therapy,
              including argon plasma coagulation and CO 2 cryosurgery. The
              success rate for the rigid procedures was 100.0\% (7/7), and the
              cure rate after 3 months was 85.7\% (6/7). A part of the tumor
              remained in the lung of 1 patient with inflammatory
              myofibroblastic tumor after bronchoscopic treatment. One patient
              with local anesthesia died of suffocation caused by tumor
              consolidation during the bronchoscopic procedure. There were no
              recurrences in 6 patients during the follow-up period. One

              occurred in clinical practice. We conducted a nationwide survey
              to evaluate the current status of care and to compare it with
              earlier reports. METHODS: A standard questionnaire was sent to
              1875 institutions to assess the clinical practice of bronchoscopy
              in Germany with respect to general issues, education,
              sedation/anaesthesia and technical aspects. RESULTS: The returned
              questionnaires cover 301,965 bronchoscopies, performed by 2158
              physicians over 12 months, making it the largest survey to date.
              The proportion of rigid bronchoscopies has decreased and amounts
              to 7.3\% at present. Atropine as a premedication is hardly used
              any more. Sedation is routinely applied in 88\% of flexible
              bronchoscopies, for which a combination of propofol and midazolam
              is preferred by most institutions (41.3\%), followed by propofol
              monotherapy (28.3\%). 74.4\% of institutions accept aspirin for
              transbronchial biopsy, 8.1\% dual platelet inhibition. 62.4\% of
              all institutions perform airway recanalisation, favouring
              cryotherapy and argon plasma coagulation. 9.1\% of bronchoscopies
              are supported by endobronchial ultrasound. CONCLUSION: Compared
              to preceding surveys, the experience of bronchoscopists,
              especially regarding interventional procedures, has increased.

              METHODS: Valid HINs, captured in the CCR or obtained through
              probabilistic linkages to provincial health insurance registries,
              were used to deterministically link prostate, female breast,

              the DAD for fiscal years 2004/2005 to 2010/2011. RESULTS: At
              least 98\% of tumours diagnosed from 2005 through 2008 had valid
              HINs in the CCR or obtained through probabilistic linkages. For
              provinces submitting day surgeries to the DAD, linkage rates to

              linked records, agreement was high for sex (99\% or more) and
              complete date of birth (97\% or more); the likelihood of a
              consistent diagnosis in the CCR and on at least one linked DAD

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The usual transbronchial coagulation techniques
              include microwave, argon plasma coagulation (APC), electrocautery
              and cryotherapy. However, there are serious clinical problems in
              the safety of each. By analyzing the experimental data and
              clinical observations, we observed the variable effects of
              different coagulation techniques via bronchofibroscopy, to look
              for an optimal interventional management of luminal bronchus
              diseases, and evaluate the safety and the equivalent point.
              METHODS: Four kinds of coagulation techniques under bronchoscopy
              were performed on the fresh bronchus of healthy sheep, and the
              pathologic changes in all groups were observed under the
              microscope. The different treatment parameters were as follows:
              microwave 60 W$\times$1 second, 3 seconds, 5 seconds and 40
              W$\times$1 second, 3 seconds, 5 seconds; APC 40 W$\times$1
              second, 3 seconds, 5 seconds; electrocautery 40 W$\times$1
              second, 3 seconds, 5 seconds; cryotherapy 100 $\Omega$$\times$60
              seconds, 120 seconds. RESULTS: After treatment, ovine bronchial
              mucosa in all groups showed pathologic changes such as local
              necrosis and amotio of the mucosa lining epithelium, local
              submucosa coagulative necrosis or tissue defects, while
              inflammation in the surrounding tissue was not obvious. Under the
              same output power and action time, different methods had
              different outcomes. The damage by APC was the most superficial,
              microwave was the second, and electrocautery caused the worst
              damage. The study also found that effects of electrocautery at 40
              W$\times$3 seconds, microwave at 40 W$\times$5 seconds or 60
              W$\times$3 seconds, APC at 40 W$\times$5 seconds and cryotherapy
              at 100 $\Omega$$\times$120 seconds were the equivalent point
              conditions. The appearance included mucosa absence, partial
              submucosa absence, and collagen fiber coagulation in treatment
              areas. CONCLUSIONS: Each coagulation technique has its own
              characteristic. It is very important to choose the appropriate
              power and action time of the suitable method according to the
              therapy requirement.",

              therapeutic and palliative methods for patients with malignant
              and benign airway obstruction. Central airway tumor obstruction
              could lead to significant dyspnea or hemoptysis and dramatically
              lower the quality of life. Such symptoms can be relieved
              immediately via bronchoscopic intervention. Endobronchial
              therapies such as neodymium yttrium aluminum garnet( Nd:YAG)
              laser therapy, argon plasma coagulation and microwave coagulation
              or stent placement are well-established treatment options. Each
              of these modalities has its specific advantages and
              disadvantages. Laser therapy is direct thermal ablation applied
              to endobronchial tumors. It has sufficient power to vaporize
              tissues and produces an excellent coagulation effect. However,
              the risk of perforation is high. On the other hand, photodynamic
              therapy has the curative potential for patients with early
              superficial lung cancer using low power laser. Moreover, it has
              recently been approved for the treatment of other cancers
              including advanced lung cancer. Stent placement is an effective
              treatment to re-establish airway patency and immediately relieve
              the patient from life-threatening dyspnea. Stent restenosis,
              migration, mucus plug and hemoptysis are common short-term and
              longterm problems. It is important to select the appropriate

              diagnostic and therapeutic procedures to care for patients with
              benign and malignant diseases of the lung, airways and pleura.
              There has been a rapid proliferation of new pulmonary procedural
              technologies over the last decade. Common diagnostic applications
              include endobronchial ultrasound, guided bronchoscopy and a
              number of pleural disease interventions. Endobronchial ultrasound
              is performed with a specially design flexible bronchoscope and
              allows safe and accurate sampling of intrathoracic structures
              through the airway wall under direct visualization. Guided
              bronchoscopy methods are granting significant improvement in the
              diagnostic yield of flexible bronchoscopy. Virtual bronchoscopy,
              radial probe endobronchial ultrasound and electromagnetic
              navigational bronchoscopy are examples of these methods.
              Interventional pulmonologists can also be trained to perform
              ultrasound guided thoracentesis, closed-needle pleural biopsy and
              medical thoracoscopy to help in the diagnosis of different
              pleural pathologies. Therapeutic applications can be used to
              efficiently bring symptomatic relief of benign and malignant
              central airway obstruction by using a myriad of flexible and
              rigid bronchoscopy techniques. Airway stenting and ablative
              techniques such as laser, electrocautery, cryosurgery and
              microdebrider techniques are example of resources that can be
              used by interventional pulmonologists for therapeutic purposes. A
              number of effective therapies for the management of malignant
              pleural disease have been studied in recent years, including
              chemical pleurodesis and tunnelled pleural catheters, greatly
              adding to our understanding of which therapy to use in which

              common disease, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary
              disease are currently available or are being developed. This
              update aims to provide the internal medicine physician with a

              assumes that under conditions of market failure, innovators
              collaborate in order to produce a public good. The phenomenon of
              open source software development shows that users program to

              after diazepam were evaluated. The effect of diazepam on rats
              temporarily immobilized with tubocurarine was also evaluated. 1.
              Focal spike activity during sleep was mildly inhibited by
              diazepam. If present in the waking state, it was markedly
              inhibited. 2. The number of episodes diminished significantly
              after diazepam. The maximum decrease occurred 30--45 minutes
              after administering diazepam and after that they slowly
              recovered. 3. Diazepam did not inhibit alteration of the phases
              of vigilance, but there was an increase in the proportion of
              telencephalic sleep with large numbers of spidles of 12--14/sec
              frequency and the incidence of REM phases rose by 250--300\%. 4.

              performed to refine and validate a previously tested model and
              measurement of consumer perception of product creativity: one
              with web-based evaluations (N = 208) of chairs and lamps and one
              with paper-based evaluations (N = 105) of individually selected
              products. Results of exploratory factor analyses indicated three
              main product creativity factors: Affect, Importance, and Novelty,
              which explained 72\% of the common variance. Results of stepwise
              regressions indicated that the Affect factor significantly
              predicts (65\% of the explained variance) willingness to purchase
              creative consumer products. One major contribution of this
              research is the finding that affect is as equally (R2 = .28)
              important as novelty (R2 = .25) in consumer perception of product
              creativity. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed
              for the Affect, Importance, and Novelty product creativity
              factors, and general creativity guidelines are provided for

              are common after atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation, and predict
              late recurrences (LR). We sought to determine the impact of
              different ablation strategies on ERAT and LR. METHODS AND
              RESULTS: The STAR-AF trial randomized 100 patients with
              paroxysmal or persistent AF to ablation of complex fractionated
              electrograms (CFAE) alone, pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) alone,
              or combined PVI + CFAE. Patients were followed for 12 months.
              ERAT was defined as any recurrence of AF, atrial tachycardia, or
              flutter (AT/AFL) >30 seconds during the first 3 months of
              follow-up. LR was defined as any recurrence of AF/AT/AFL >30
              seconds 3-12 months post. Forty-nine patients experienced ERAT.
              The index ablation strategy was the only independent predictor of
              ERAT on multivariate analysis (HR 2.24 PVI vs PVI + CFAE; and HR
              2.65 CFAE vs PVI + CFAE). Fifty-two patients experienced LR. The
              presence of ERAT (HR 3.23), the use of antiarrhythmic drug (AAD)
              in the first 3 months postablation (HR 2.85), and the index
              ablation strategy were independently associated with LR (HR 3.42
              PVI vs PVI + CFAE; HR 4.72 CFAE vs PVI + CFAE). Thirty-five of 49
              (71\%) patients with ERAT and 17 (33\%) of 51 patients without
              ERAT had LR (P < 0.0001). Among patients with ERAT, increased
              left atrium size (HR 1.08), the use of AAD in the first 3 months
              postablation (HR 2.86) and the index ablation strategy were
              independently associated with LR (HR 4.77 PVI vs PVI + CFAE; HR
              4.45 CFAE vs PVI + CFAE). CONCLUSION: ERAT is common following AF
              ablation and is strongly associated with LR. Although CFAE
              ablation alone results in higher rates of early and LR, the
              addition of CFAE to PVI results in increased long-term success
              without an increase in ERAT.",

               needs and activities, to assist the early stages of the
               user-centered design (UCD) process. Although it is acknowledged
               as a key issue for the integration of UCD to innovative design

               methodological frameworks to assist prospective ergonomics.
               Indeed, conventional methods of product use analysis are of
               little use when working with ill-defined product concepts, since
               it may be difficult in such cases to define exactly what
               ``future use'' is. In this paper, we contend that creative
               design methods, which are often used to solve technical design
               problems or to define innovative product concepts, may also help
               generate scenarios of future use. We carried out simulations of
               design meetings focused on this particular task, in order to
               assess the effects of such methods on a design team's ability to

              cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy. A
              single course of any of these treatments, however, leaves between
              one-third and one-half of patients insufficiently improved and

              medication and CBT have been combined (COMB). A few controlled
              clinical trials have recently compared COMB with monotherapy.
              TADS (Treatment for Adolescents with Depression Study) randomly
              assigned 439 adolescents with major depressive disorder to
              fluoxetine, CBT, COMB or clinical management with placebo. After
              12 weeks of treatment, both fluoxetine and COMB reduced
              depression more than CBT or placebo did, but only COMB was
              effective in inducing remission, achieving functional recovery
              and reducing suicidal ideation. After 36 weeks of treatment,
              there was no difference in improvement among treatments, but more
              suicidal events occurred in the medication only group than in the
              CBT only group. However, in another trial, ADAPT (Adolescent
              Depression and Psychotherapy Trial), involving 208 youths, no
              advantages of COMB over usual care with an SSRI could be
              detected. In a third trial, TORDIA (Treatment of Resistant
              Depression in Adolescence), which randomized 334 patients with an
              major depression unresponsive to previous SSRI treatment, COMB

              These and other, smaller trials of COMB in adolescent depression
              are reviewed in this article. It is concluded that, while there
              is no univocal support for the superiority of COMB, two

              upon presenting signs and symptoms, with the result that current

              and pathophysiology but also the development of new treatments.
              Discussion The National Institute of Mental Health began the
              Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project in 2009 to develop a
              research classification system for mental disorders based upon
              dimensions of neurobiology and observable behavior. RDoC supports
              research to explicate fundamental biobehavioral dimensions that
              cut across current heterogeneous disorder categories. We
              summarize the rationale, status and long-term goals of RDoC,
              outline challenges in developing a research classification system
              (such as construct validity and a suitable process for updating

  abstract = "IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: At any one time, major depressive
              disorder (MDD) affects 4 - 6\% of adolescents. When untreated,
              MDD leads to a high immediate and subsequent suicide risk,
              long-term chronicity and a poor psychosocial outcome. Whereas
              psychotherapy can be effective in mild depression, it seems to be
              less effective in moderate and severe depression. However,
              although the use of antidepressants increased markedly during the
              1990s, in recent years it has decreased as a result of concerns
              regarding the emergence of suicidality during antidepressant
              treatment. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: Are antidepressants
              truly effective? What is the relationship between different
              treatments for depression - psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy -
              alone or in combination? Can antidepressants increase the risk of
              suicide in some adolescents? Can antidepressants reduce suicide
              risk in suicidal adolescents? WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: There is
              evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can
              improve adolescent depression better than placebo, although the
              magnitude of the antidepressant effect is 'small to moderate',
              because of a high placebo response. The SSRI with the best rate
              of response compared to placebo is fluoxetine. The increased risk
              of suicidality in adolescents, compared to adults, is weak but
              consistent across most studies. However, epidemiological studies
              do not support a relationship between use of antidepressants and
              suicide rate. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: A cautious and well-monitored
              use of antidepressant medications is a first-line treatment
              option in adolescents with moderate to severe depression. Low
              rates of remission with current treatment strategies indicate
              that further research in both psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy

              drug resistance are critical for improving patient care and
              decreasing the spread of TB. Xpert\textregistered{} MTB/RIF assay
              (Xpert) is a rapid, automated test that can detect both TB and
              rifampicin resistance, within two hours after starting the test,
              with minimal hands-on technical time, but is more expensive than
              conventional sputum microscopy. OBJECTIVES: To assess the
              diagnostic accuracy of Xpert for pulmonary TB (TB detection),
              both where Xpert was used as an initial test replacing
              microscopy, and where Xpert was used as an add-on test following
              a negative smear microscopy result.To assess the diagnostic
              accuracy of Xpert for rifampicin resistance detection where Xpert
              was used as the initial test, replacing conventional
              culture-based drug susceptibility testing.The population of
              interest was adults suspected of having pulmonary TB or
              multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), with or without HIV infection.
              SEARCH METHODS: We performed a comprehensive search of the
              following databases: Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group
              Specialized Register; MEDLINE; EMBASE; ISI Web of Knowledge;
              MEDION; LILACS; BIOSIS; and SCOPUS. We also searched the
              metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) and the search portal of
              the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to
              identify ongoing trials. We performed searches on 25 September
              2011 and we repeated them on 15 December 2011, without language
              restriction. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized
              controlled trials, cross-sectional, and cohort studies that used
              respiratory specimens to compare Xpert with culture for detecting
              TB and Xpert with conventional phenotypic drug susceptibility
              testing for detecting rifampicin resistance. DATA COLLECTION AND
              ANALYSIS: For each study, two review authors independently
              extracted a set of data using a standardized data extraction
              form. When possible, we extracted data for subgroups by smear and
              HIV status. We assessed the quality of studies using the QUADAS-2
              tool. We carried out meta-analyses to estimate the pooled
              sensitivity and specificity of Xpert separately for TB detection
              and rifampicin resistance detection using a bivariate
              random-effects model. We estimated the median pooled sensitivity
              and specificity and their 95\% credible intervals (CrI). MAIN
              RESULTS: We identified 18 unique studies as eligible for this
              review, including two multicentre international studies, one with
              five and the other with six distinct study centres. The majority
              of studies (55.6\%) were performed in low-income and
              middle-income countries. In 17 of the 18 studies, Xpert was
              performed by trained technicians in reference laboratories.When
              used as an initial test replacing smear microscopy (15 studies,
              7517 participants), Xpert achieved a pooled sensitivity of 88\%
              (95\% CrI 83\% to 92\%) and pooled specificity of 98\% (95\% CrI
              97\% to 99\%). As an add-on test following a negative smear
              microscopy result (14 studies, 5719 participants), Xpert yielded
              a pooled sensitivity of 67\% (95\% CrI 58\% to 74\%) and pooled
              specificity of 98\% (95\% CrI 97\% to 99\%). In clinical
              subgroups, we found the following accuracy estimates: the pooled
              sensitivity was 98\% (95\% CrI 97\% to 99\%) for smear-positive,
              culture-positive TB and 68\% (95\% CrI 59\% to 75\%) for
              smear-negative, culture-positive TB (15 studies); the pooled
              sensitivity was 80\% (95\% CrI 67\% to 88\%) in people living
              with HIV and 89\% (95\% CrI 81\% to 94\%) in people without HIV
              infection (four studies). For rifampicin resistance detection (11
              studies, 2340 participants), Xpert achieved a pooled sensitivity
              of 94\% (95\% CrI 87\% to 97\%) and pooled specificity of 98\%
              (95\% CrI 97\% to 99\%). In a separate analysis, Xpert could
              distinguish between TB and nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) in
              clinical samples with high accuracy: among 139 specimens with
              NTM, Xpert was positive in only one specimen that grew NTM.In a
              hypothetical cohort of 1000 individuals suspected of having
              rifampicin resistance (a proxy for MDR-TB), where the prevalence
              of rifampicin resistance is 30\%, we estimated that on average
              Xpert would wrongly identify 14 patients as being rifampicin
              resistant. In comparison, where the prevalence of rifampicin
              resistance is only 2\%, we estimated that the number of
              individuals wrongly identified as rifampicin resistant would
              increase to 20, an increase of 43\%. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This
              review shows that Xpert used as an initial diagnostic test for TB
              detection and rifampicin resistance detection in patients
              suspected of having TB, MDR-TB, or HIV-associated TB is sensitive
              and specific. Xpert may also be valuable as an add-on test
              following microscopy for patients who have previously been found
              to be smear-negative. An Xpert result that is positive for
              rifampicin resistance should be carefully interpreted and take
              into consideration the risk of MDR-TB in a given patient and the
              expected prevalence of MDR-TB in a given setting.Studies in this
              review mainly assessed sensitivity and specificity of the test
              when used in reference laboratories in research investigations.
              Most studies were performed in high TB burden countries. Ongoing
              use of Xpert in high TB burden countries will contribute to the
              evidence base on the diagnostic accuracy and clinical impact of
              Xpert in routine programmatic and peripheral health care
              settings, including settings where the test is performed at the
              point of care.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Falls are a verified cause of morbidity and mortality
              in adults older than 65 years. Exercise under the direction of a
              physical therapist has been shown to reduce the risk of falls in
              older adults; however, it is not clear whether physical
              therapist-directed group-based exercise could produce similar
              results. PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review was to
              summarize the evidence on the effectiveness of physical
              therapist-administered group-based exercise when compared with
              various controls for falls prevention and improvement of quality
              of life. METHODS: A computerized search of PubMed and CINAHL was
              performed. An exhaustive hand search was also performed of the
              references of all full-text articles. Preferred Reporting Items
              for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed
              for this review. Studies were included if they met the following
              criteria: (1) comparison of group-based exercise led by a
              physical therapist to a control group; (2) ambulatory elderly men
              or women, aged 65 years or older; (3) subjects in the community
              or institutional setting; (4) the use of 1 or more outcome
              measures related to functional balance and/or quality of life;
              (5) randomized controlled or clinical trials; and (6) published
              in English, between December 1, 2001, and June 7, 2012. The PEDro
              scale was used to assess the quality of each study included in
              this review. RESULTS: The computerized search strategy and hand
              search revealed 213 potential articles, 10 of which met the
              inclusion criteria. After assessment with the PEDro scale, 8 of
              these were considered high-quality studies (score > 6/10). Seven
              studies compared group-based exercise to a nonexercise control
              group, while 3 studies compared group-based exercise with a
              physical therapist-prescribed home exercise program. Outcomes
              measured include fall rate, balance, physical performance,
              health-related quality of life, and fear of falling. DISCUSSION:
              When group-based exercise was compared with no intervention,
              group-based exercise was found to be more effective in decreasing
              fall frequency, increase balance, and improve quality of life.
              When compared with a physical therapist-prescribed home exercise
              program, the group-based exercise results were not statistically
              different but showed improvements in some quality of life and
              physical functioning measures. There is also some evidence to
              suggest that group-based exercise promotes greater patient
              satisfaction and exercise adherence. CONCLUSION: There is
              preliminary evidence to suggest that the group-based exercise is
              effective for falls prevention, quality-of-life enhancement, and
              balance improvements in the older adults comparable with
              traditional home exercise programs.",

              events that cause considerable morbidity and mortality for older
              people. This is an update of a review first published in 2010.
              OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of interventions designed
              to reduce falls by older people in care facilities and hospitals.
              SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle
              Trauma Group Specialised Register (March 2012); The Cochrane
              Library 2012, Issue 3; MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL (all to March
              2012); ongoing trial registers (to August 2012), and reference
              lists of articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled
              trials of interventions to reduce falls in older people in
              residential or nursing care facilities or hospitals. DATA
              COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently
              assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We used a rate ratio
              (RaR) and 95\% confidence interval (CI) to compare the rate of
              falls (e.g. falls per person year) between intervention and
              control groups. For risk of falling we used a risk ratio (RR) and
              95\% CI based on the number of people falling (fallers) in each
              group. We pooled results where appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: We
              included 60 trials (60,345 participants), 43 trials (30,373
              participants) in care facilities, and 17 (29,972 participants) in
              hospitals.Results from 13 trials testing exercise interventions
              in care facilities were inconsistent. Overall, there was no
              difference between intervention and control groups in rate of
              falls (RaR 1.03, 95\% CI 0.81 to 1.31; 8 trials, 1844
              participants) or risk of falling (RR 1.07, 95\% CI 0.94 to 1.23;
              8 trials, 1887 participants). Post hoc subgroup analysis by level
              of care suggested that exercise might reduce falls in people in
              intermediate level facilities, and increase falls in facilities
              providing high levels of nursing care.In care facilities, vitamin
              D supplementation reduced the rate of falls (RaR 0.63, 95\% CI
              0.46 to 0.86; 5 trials, 4603 participants), but not risk of
              falling (RR 0.99, 95\% CI 0.90 to 1.08; 6 trials, 5186
              participants).For multifactorial interventions in care
              facilities, the rate of falls (RaR 0.78, 95\% CI 0.59 to 1.04; 7
              trials, 2876 participants) and risk of falling (RR 0.89, 95\% CI
              0.77 to 1.02; 7 trials, 2632 participants) suggested possible
              benefits, but this evidence was not conclusive.In subacute wards
              in hospital, additional physiotherapy (supervised exercises) did
              not significantly reduce rate of falls (RaR 0.54, 95\% CI 0.16 to
              1.81; 1 trial, 54 participants) but achieved a significant
              reduction in risk of falling (RR 0.36, 95\% CI 0.14 to 0.93; 2
              trials, 83 participants).In one trial in a subacute ward (54
              participants), carpet flooring significantly increased the rate
              of falls compared with vinyl flooring (RaR 14.73, 95\% CI 1.88 to
              115.35) and potentially increased the risk of falling (RR 8.33,
              95\% CI 0.95 to 73.37).One trial (1822 participants) testing an
              educational session by a trained research nurse targeting
              individual fall risk factors in patients at high risk of falling
              in acute medical wards achieved a significant reduction in risk
              of falling (RR 0.29, 95\% CI 0.11 to 0.74).Overall,
              multifactorial interventions in hospitals reduced the rate of
              falls (RaR 0.69, 95\% CI 0.49 to 0.96; 4 trials, 6478
              participants) and risk of falling (RR 0.71, 95\% CI 0.46 to 1.09;
              3 trials, 4824 participants), although the evidence for risk of
              falling was inconclusive. Of these, one trial in a subacute
              setting reported the effect was not apparent until after 45 days
              in hospital. Multidisciplinary care in a geriatric ward after hip
              fracture surgery compared with usual care in an orthopaedic ward
              significantly reduced rate of falls (RaR 0.38, 95\% CI 0.19 to
              0.74; 1 trial, 199 participants) and risk of falling (RR 0.41,
              95\% CI 0.20 to 0.83). More trials are needed to confirm the
              effectiveness of multifactorial interventions in acute and
              subacute hospital settings. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In care
              facilities, vitamin D supplementation is effective in reducing
              the rate of falls. Exercise in subacute hospital settings appears
              effective but its effectiveness in care facilities remains
              uncertain due to conflicting results, possibly associated with
              differences in interventions and levels of dependency. There is
              evidence that multifactorial interventions reduce falls in
              hospitals but the evidence for risk of falling was inconclusive.
              Evidence for multifactorial interventions in care facilities
              suggests possible benefits, but this was inconclusive.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To develop a model to produce real-time, updated
              forecasts of patients' intensive care unit length of stay using
              naturally generated provider orders. The model was designed to be
              integrated within a computerized decision support system to
              improve patient flow management. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort
              study. SETTING: Twenty-six bed pediatric intensive care unit
              within an urban, academic children's hospital using a
              computerized order entry system. PATIENTS: A total of 2,178
              consecutive pediatric intensive care unit admissions during a
              16-month time period. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We obtained
              unit length of stay measurements, time-stamped provider orders,
              age, admission source, and readmission status. A joint
              discrete-time logistic regression model was developed to produce
              probabilistic length of stay forecasts from continuously updated
              provider orders. Accuracy was assessed by comparing forecasted
              expected discharge time with observed discharge time, rank
              probability scoring, and calibration curves. Cross-validation
              procedures were conducted. The distribution of length of stay was
              heavily right-skewed with a mean of 3.5 days (95\% confidence
              interval 0.3-19.1). Provider orders were predictive of length of
              stay in real-time accurately forecasting discharge within a 12-hr
              window: 46\% for patients within 1 day of discharge, 34\% for
              patients within 2 days of discharge, and 27\% for patients within
              3 days of discharge. The forecast model incorporating predictive
              orders demonstrated significant improvements in accuracy compared
              with forecasts based solely on empirical and temporal
              information. Seventeen predictive orders were found, grouped by
              medication, ventilation, laboratory, diet, activity, foreign
              body, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. CONCLUSIONS:
              Provider orders reflect dynamic changes in patients' conditions,
              making them useful for real-time length of stay prediction and
              patient flow management. Patients' length of stay represent a
              major source of variability in intensive care unit resource
              utilization and if accurately predicted and communicated, may
              lead to proactive bed management with more efficient patient
              flow.",

  author   = "Balzer, Katrin and Bremer, Martina and Schramm, Susanne and
              L{\"u}hmann, Dagmar and Raspe, Heiner",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: An ageing population, a growing prevalence of chronic
              diseases and limited financial resources for health care underpin
              the importance of prevention of disabling health disorders and
              care dependency in the elderly. A wide variety of measures is
              generally available for the prevention of falls and fall-related
              injuries. The spectrum ranges from diagnostic procedures for
              identifying individuals at risk of falling to complex
              interventions for the removal or reduction of identified risk
              factors. However, the clinical and economic effectiveness of the
              majority of recommended strategies for fall prevention is
              unclear. Against this background, the literature analyses in this
              HTA report aim to support decision-making for effective and
              efficient fall prevention. RESEARCH QUESTIONS: The pivotal
              research question addresses the effectiveness of single
              interventions and complex programmes for the prevention of falls
              and fall-related injuries. The target population are the elderly
              (> 60 years), living in their own housing or in long term care
              facilities. Further research questions refer to the
              cost-effectiveness of fall prevention measures, and their
              ethical, social and legal implications. METHODS: Systematic
              literature searches were performed in 31 databases covering the
              publication period from January 2003 to January 2010. While the
              effectiveness of interventions is solely assessed on the basis of
              randomised controlled trials (RCT), the assessment of the
              effectiveness of diagnostic procedures also considers prospective
              accuracy studies. In order to clarify social, ethical and legal
              aspects all studies deemed relevant with regard to content were
              taken into consideration, irrespective of their study design.
              Study selection and critical appraisal were conducted by two
              independent assessors. Due to clinical heterogeneity of the
              studies no meta-analyses were performed. RESULTS: Out of 12,000
              references retrieved by literature searches, 184 meet the
              inclusion criteria. However, to a variable degree the validity of
              their results must be rated as compromised due to different
              biasing factors. In summary, it appears that the performance of
              tests or the application of parameters to identify individuals at
              risk of falling yields little or no clinically relevant
              information. Positive effects of exercise interventions may be
              expected in relatively young and healthy seniors, while studies
              indicate opposite effects in the fragile elderly. For this
              specific vulnerable population the modification of the housing
              environment shows protective effects. A low number of studies,
              low quality of studies or inconsistent results lead to the
              conclusion that the effectiveness of the following interventions
              has to be rated unclear yet: correction of vision disorders,
              modification of psychotropic medication, vitamin D
              supplementation, nutritional supplements, psychological
              interventions, education of nursing personnel, multiple and
              multifactorial programs as well as the application of hip
              protectors. For the context of the German health care system the
              economic evaluations of fall prevention retrieved by the
              literature searches yield very few useful results.
              Cost-effectiveness calculations of fall prevention are mostly
              based on weak effectiveness data as well as on epidemiological
              and cost data from foreign health care systems. Ethical analysis
              demonstrates ambivalent views of the target population concerning
              fall risk and the necessity of fall prevention. The willingness
              to take up preventive measures depends on a variety of personal
              factors, the quality of information, guidance and
              decision-making, the prevention program itself and social
              support. THE ANALYSIS OF PAPERS REGARDING LEGAL ISSUES SHOWS
              THREE MAIN CHALLENGES: the uncertainty of which standard of care
              has to be expected with regard to fall prevention, the necessity
              to consider the specific conditions of every single case when
              measures for fall prevention are applied, and the difficulty to
              balance the rights to autonomous decision making and physical
              integrity. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of clinical
              effectiveness of interventions for fall prevention is complicated
              by inherent methodological problems (esp. absence of blinding)
              and meaningful clinical heterogeneity of available studies.
              Therefore meta-analyses are not appropriate, and single study
              results are difficult to interpret. Both problems also impair the
              informative value of economic analyses. With this background it
              has to be stated that current recommendations regarding fall
              prevention in the elderly are not fully supported by scientific
              evidence. In particular, for the generation of new
              recommendations the dependency of probable effects on specific
              characteristics of the target populations or care settings should
              be taken into consideration. This also applies to the variable
              factors influencing the willingness of the target population to
              take up and pursue preventive measures. In the planning of future
              studies equal weight should be placed on methodological rigour
              (freedom from biases) and transferability of results into routine
              care. Economic analyses require input of German data, either in
              form of a ``piggy back study'' or in form of a modelling study
              that reflects the structures of the German health care system and
              is based on German epidemiological and cost data.",

              formed their habits at different periods, and the extent of the
              reduction in risk when cigarette smoking is stopped at different
              ages. Design Prospective study that has continued from 1951 to
              2001. Setting United Kingdom. Participants 34 439 male British
              doctors. Information about their smoking habits was obtained in
              1951, and periodically thereafter; cause specific mortality was
              monitored for 50 years. Main outcome measures Overall mortality
              by smoking habit, considering separately men born in different
              periods. Results The excess mortality associated with smoking
              chiefly involved vascular, neoplastic, and respiratory diseases
              that can be caused by smoking. Men born in 1900-1930 who smoked
              only cigarettes and continued smoking died on average about 10
              years younger than lifelong non-smokers. Cessation at age 60, 50,
              40, or 30 years gained, respectively, about 3, 6, 9, or 10 years
              of life expectancy. The excess mortality associated with
              cigarette smoking was less for men born in the 19th century and
              was greatest for men born in the 1920s. The cigarette smoker
              versus non-smoker probabilities of dying in middle age (35-69)
              were 42\% $\nu$24\% (a twofold death rate ratio) for those born
              in 1900-1909, but were 43\% $\nu$ 15\% (a threefold death rate
              ratio) for those born in the 1920s. At older ages, the cigarette
              smoker versus non-smoker probabilities of surviving from age 70
              to 90 were 10\% $\nu$ 12\% at the death rates of the 1950s (that
              is, among men born around the 1870s) but were 7\% $\nu$ 33\%
              (again a threefold death rate ratio) at the death rates of the
              1990s (that is, among men born around the 1910s). Conclusion A
              substantial progressive decrease in the mortality rates among
              non-smokers over the past half century (due to prevention and
              improved treatment of disease) has been wholly outweighed, among
              cigarette smokers, by a progressive increase in the smoker $\nu$
              non-smoker death rate ratio due to earlier and more intensive use
              of cigarettes. Among the men born around 1920, prolonged
              cigarette smoking from early adult life tripled age specific
              mortality rates, but cessation at age 50 halved the hazard, and
              cessation at age 30 avoided almost all of it.",

  abstract = "In 1951 the British Medical Association forwarded to all British
              doctors a questionnaire about their smoking habits, and 34440 men
              replied. With few exceptions, all men who replied in 1951 have
              been followed for 20 years. The certified causes of all 10 072
              deaths and subsequent changes in smoking habits were recorded.
              The ratio of the death rate among cigarette smokers to that among
              lifelong non-smokers of comparable age was, for men under 70
              years, about 2:1, while for men over 70 years it was about 1-5:1.
              These ratios suggest that between a half and a third of all
              cigarette smokers will die because of their smoking, if the
              excess death rates are actually caused by smoking. To investigate
              whether this is the case, the relation of many different causes
              of death to age and tobacco consumption were examined, as were
              the effects of giving up smoking. Smoking caused death chiefly by
              heart disease among middle-aged men (and, with a less extreme
              relative risk, among old men,) lung cancer, chronic obstructive
              lung disease, and various vascular diseases. The distinctive
              features of this study were the completeness of follow-up, the
              accuracy of death certification, and the fact that the study
              population as a whole reduced its cigarette consumption
              substantially during the period of observation. As a result lung
              cancer grew relatively less common as the study progressed, but
              other cancers did not, thus illustrating in an unusual way the

              clinics at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto

              sixty patients aged 18 to 65 meeting DSM-IV for major depressive

              weeks, of symptoms sufficient to meet the criteria for major
              depression on Module A of the SCID. Results Intention to treat
              analyses revealed a significant interaction between the quality
              of acute phase remission and subsequent prevention of relapse in
              randomized patients (p = .03). Among unstable remitters (defined
              as 1 or more HRSD >7 during remission) patients in both MBCT and
              M-ADM showed a 73\% decrease in hazard compared to PLA (p = .03),
              whereas for stable remitters (all HRSD $\leq$ 7 during remission)
              there were no group differences in survival. Findings remained

              difficult as systems become more complex. Previous attempts at
              the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Medical Center
              to reduce door-to-floor (D2F) time -the time required to move an
              ill patient through the emergency department (ED) to an
              appropriate inpatient bed-had not resulted in meaningful
              improvement. An analysis of why attempts at decreasing D2F times
              in the ED had failed, with attention to contextual factors,
              yields recommendations on how to decrease D2F time. METHODS: A
              team of 11 internal medicine residents, in partnership with the
              Patient Flow Executive Steering Committee, performed a literature
              review, process mapping, and analysis of the admissions process.
              The team conducted interviews with medical center staff across
              disciplines, members of high-performing patient care units, and
              leaders of peer institutions who had undertaken similar efforts.
              FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Each of the following three
              domains-(1) Improving Work Flow, (2) Changing Culture, and (3)
              Understanding Incentives-is independently an important source of
              resistance and opportunity. However, the improvement work and
              understanding of complexity science suggest that all three
              domains must be addressed simultaneously to effect meaningful
              change. Recommendations include eliminating redundant and
              frustrating processes; encouraging multidisciplinary
              collaboration; fostering trust between departments; providing
              feedback on individual performance; enhancing provider buy-in;
              and, ultimately, uniting staff behind a common goal. CONCLUSION:
              By conceptualizing the hospital as a complex adaptive system,
              multiple interrelated groups can be encouraged to work together
              and accomplish a common goal.",

              location monitoring and management. Real-time data from an active
              infrared/radio frequency identification tracking system provides
              patient location data that are robust and can be compared with an
              ''expected process'' model to automatically flag wrong-location
              events as soon as they occur. The system also generates messages
              that are automatically sent to process managers via the hospital

              annunciate errors. We deployed the system to detect and
              annunciate ``patient-in-wrong-OR'' events. The system detected
              all ''wrong-operating room (OR)'' events, and all ``wrong-OR''

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To report Aboriginal patients' views about effective
              communication between Aboriginal people and health service
              providers in Western Australian hospital settings. DESIGN,
              SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Qualitative study involving indepth
              interviews between 1 March 2006 and 30 September 2007 with 30
              Aboriginal people affected by cancer from across WA. MAIN OUTCOME
              MEASURES: Aboriginal patients' views about the quality of
              communication within the hospitals, factors impairing
              communication and suggestions for improvement. RESULTS: Factors
              crucial to effective patient-provider communication such as
              language, shared understanding, knowledge and use of medical
              terminology require attention. Additionally, communication
              between Aboriginal people and health care professionals needs to
              be understood within a broader sociocultural and political
              context. Fear of the medical system and of being disempowered;
              mistrust; collective memories of the experience of colonisation
              and its aftermath; lack of understanding of Aboriginal customs,
              values, lifestyle and the importance of family and land; and
              experiences of racism were key issues impairing communication.
              Health service providers' inability to interpret non-verbal
              communication and the symbolism of hospital environments also
              posed problems. CONCLUSION: Key areas for the attention of health
              service providers in communicating and caring for Aboriginal
              people in the hospital setting include culturally sensitive and
              empathetic personal contact, acknowledgement and respect for
              Aboriginal family structures, culture and life circumstances, an
              understanding of the significant role of non-verbal
              communication, and the importance of history, land and community.
              Employing more Aboriginal health workers in hospitals, and
              allowing Aboriginal people to participate at a decision-making
              level in hospitals is likely to improve Aboriginal people's
              access to cancer treatment, and would be important symbols of

              hospital ED. METHODS: Detailed understanding was gained through
              process mapping with staff followed by the identification of
              value streams (those patients likely to be discharged from the
              ED, those who were likely to be admitted) and the implementation
              of a process of seeing those patients that minimized complex
              queuing in the ED. RESULTS: Streaming had a significant impact on
              waiting times and total durations of stay in the ED. There was a
              general flattening of the waiting time across all groups. A
              slight increase in wait for Triage categories 2 and 3 patients
              was offset by reductions in wait for Triage category 4 patients.
              All groups of patients spent significantly less overall time in

              any time decreased. There was a significant reduction in number

              patients cared for by a specific team of doctors and nurses, and

              four interventions in clinical operations to decrease delays in

              radiofrequency (RF) characteristics on acute pulmonary vein
              reconnection (PVR) and outcome after PVAC ablation. PVI with
              additional ablation of PVR (PVI + PVR) was compared to PVI-only.
              METHODS: In 40 consecutive patients, after PVAC-guided PVI,
              adenosine and a 1-hour waiting time were used to unmask and
              ablate acute PVR (PVI + PVR group). RF-characteristics and 1-year
              AF freedom were compared post hoc to 40 clinically matched
              patients undergoing PVI only (PVI-only group). Custom-made
              software was used to assess RF characteristics of the PVAC
              applications needed to obtain baseline PVI. RESULTS: There was no
              difference in clinical characteristics or baseline RF-profile
              between both groups. Acute PVR was observed and ablated in 38 of
              160 veins (24\%). AF-freedom after PVI + PVR was higher than PVI
              (85\% vs 65\%, P 48°) but low power (<3W) was higher (28 $\pm$
              18\% vs 11 $\pm$ 11\%, P < 0.0001). Within the PVI + PVR group,
              when comparing PVs with and without PVR, the percentage of low

              24\% of PVs exhibit acute reconnection. Additional ablation of
              reconnection improves clinical outcome. (2) Acute reconnection as

              ablation with a considerable number of applications with high
              temperature but low power. (3) If PV isolation is obtained with

              studies of health occupational relations. A ``negotiated order''
              perspective was applied to a multi-site setting to articulate the
              ways in which clinicians' roles, accountabilities and
              contributions to patient care are shaped by the care setting and
              are influenced by the management of patient pathways. The study
              responds to the polarized debate between a critical perspective
              that calls for collaboration as the re-distribution of
              occupational power, and a functionalist view that argues for
              better coordination of health care teams. The study draws on data
              from 63 interviews, 68 focus groups and 209 h of observation
              across acute and non-acute health services within a
              state/territory in Australia. The paper reveals the exercise of
              both ``competitive power'' and ``collaborative power'' in the

              aims to provide an overview of the evidence in the literature to
              inform clinicians who are concerned by reports linking SSRI use
              with increased incidence of suicidal ideation in adolescents with

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: shared or Collaborative Care in the treatment of
              Depression is an evidence based intervention which has been shown
              to be more effective than ordinary general Practitioner care in
              the treatment of Depression, however, it is not yet Government
              policy in the United Kingdom. We aimed to bring together in one
              place all the studies which have been carried out, up till mid
              2009, in order to demonstrate the evidence that shared
              collaborative care has important advantages in terms both of
              depression outcomes and cost benefits, in order to argue for the
              adoption of this approach in the United Kingdom and n Europe.
              METHODS: we carried out a literature search using PUBMED in order
              to identify and describe all trials, systematic reviews and
              Metanalyses which have been carried out on shared care until mid
              2009. We also described a shared care service for depression
              which some of us had been involved in developing and working in
              in Luton in the late 1990's. We have excluded papers which
              describe trials which have not yet been carried out, and instead
              focussed on the trials which have reported. RESULTS: it has been
              demonstrated in numerous recent studies that shared care in the
              treatment of depression, which includes the training of General
              Practitoners in the treatment of depression, and the provision in
              Primary Care of a Nurse specialist or another professional who
              will impart psycho-education, ensure concordance with medication,
              and may provide psychotherapy, leads to both improved treatment
              outcomes and increased doctor and patient satisfaction, as well
              providing some cost-benefits, despite somewhat increased
              immediate costs. This is the case in both adult and adolescent
              patients, while in the case of diabetic patients depression is
              improved, despite the lack of improvement in glycaemic control.
              The shared care intervention continues to be useful in the case
              of patients with resistant depressive symptoms, though a longer
              input will be necessary in such cases. Patients with subthreshold
              depression will not benefit as much, and patients expressed more
              satisfaction when psychological interventions were offered. It is
              also the case that collaborative or shared care is effective in
              treating depression in the elderly. This is shown by studies
              which include older patients who also suffer from multiple health
              conditions, arthritis, diabetes, anxiety and PTSD, the poorer,
              those with suicidal ideation, and also in Ethnic Minorities.
              DISCUSSION: The results described above are mostly based on
              studies carried out in the USA, but similar studies have been
              reported from the United Kingdom, and are consistent with the
              experience of the service in Luton which we describe. From these
              results it would seem important that shared, collaborative care,
              with primary and secondary care doctors (General Practitioners
              and Psychiatrists) working as part of a single team, with the
              help of mental health practitioners attached to primary care, but
              with easy access to secondary care is a productive way of
              optimising the treatment of depression. In the UK, however, it
              has not yet been possible to develop such a service for the whole
              population. This is becausein the UK, General Practice is managed
              by Primary Care Trusts, while Secondary Care, including
              Psychiatry, is managed by Mental Health Trusts. This has led the
              National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence, and indeed
              local commissioners of care to focus on a Stepped Model for the
              treatment of depression, with one key issue being access (or
              referral) to secondary care, and discharge back to primary care,
              with a group of Mental Health workers focussing on the
              facilitation (or gate-keeping) of these processes, rather than
              focussing on actually optimising outcomes of care. CONCLUSION:
              the evidence argues for the development of collaborative care
              between primary and secondary care for the treatment of
              Depression. This will require common medication guidelines across
              both Primary and Secondary Care, easy access so that General
              Practitioners can receive advice from Psychiatrists about
              patients, and the use of Mental Health Professionals to provide
              patients with psycho-education, support of concordance with
              treatment, and psychotherapy. It may be that, in order for this
              to be achieved, services may need to be re-structured, to allow
              easy communication between professionals.",

              estimates of the adequacy of treatment received by Canadians
              having suffered a major depressive disorder (MDD) and examine
              factors associated with this adequacy. To evaluate the impact of

              Health Survey, cycle 1.2: Mental Health and Well-Being (CCHS
              1.2), a nationally representative survey conducted in 2002 and
              targetting persons aged 15 years or older living in private
              dwellings. In order to calculate the prevalence of treatment
              adequacy, we used a sample of 1,563 individuals meeting the
              criteria for MDD in the 12 months preceding the survey. A subset
              of 831 subjects who reported having used health services for
              mental health purposes at least once during that time served to
              identify the factors associated with treatment adequacy.
              MEASUREMENTS: Four definitions of minimally adequate treatment
              were considered and covariates were selected according to a
              well-known behavioral model. The analyses consisted of prevalence
              estimates and logistic regression models. RESULTS: Among selected
              subjects, 55\% received guideline-concordant treatment according
              to the Canadian guidelines. Inadequacy was more prevalent in
              rural settings, for less complex cases, and in the general
              medical sector. Depending on the definition, prevalence of
              guideline-concordant treatment ranged between 48 and 71\%, and
              factors associated with guideline-concordant treatment were
              mainly need factors and sector of care. CONCLUSIONS: A large
              proportion of people with a depressive disorder do not receive
              minimally adequate treatment. Improved access to and quality of

              physicians are unsure about which treatment approaches are
              effective and how the treatment should be planned. METHOD: A
              systematic literature search was carried out in electronic
              databases and study registries and as a manual search. More than
              450 studies (mostly randomized controlled trials [RCTs]) were
              identified and summarized in five evidence tables. The ensuing
              recommendations were agreed upon in a consensus conference in
              which 23 organizations were represented. RESULTS: The recommended
              treatment of first choice for children from age 8 onward and for
              adolescents is either cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) (Cohen's
              d [effect strength]: 0.5-2) or interpersonal psychotherapy
              (Cohen's d: 0.5-0.6). Fluoxetine is recommended for drug
              treatment (Cohen's d: 0.3-5.6), either alone or in combination
              with CBT. The analysis revealed a lower level of evidence for
              psychodynamic or systemic psychotherapy or for drug treatment
              with escitalopram, citalopram, or sertraline. For mild or

              and conduct in males. Sertraline was the most prescribed
              antidepressant for the treatment of major depressive disorder,
              followed by fluvoxamine and tianeptine. Fluvoxamine was the most
              prescribed antidepressant for the treatment of anxiety disorders
              and mixed disorders of emotions and conduct. Off-label
              prescribing of antidepressants was found in 85.6\% of young
              patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study found considerably lower
              prevalence and higher off-label rate of antidepressant
              prescriptions to young people in Croatia to that in other
              European Countries and in the United States. Selective serotonine

              hospital cost savings, relative to heparin (HEP)-based
              regimens$\pm$glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPIs). Whether
              these benefits persist with the use of prasugrel, a new
              third-generation oral thienopyridine, has not been previously
              evaluated. METHODS: Using the Premier hospital database, 6986
              patients treated with prasugrel who underwent elective, urgent,
              or primary PCI between quarter 3, 2009 and quarter 4, 2010 from
              166 US hospitals were identified. These patients received either
              BIV (n=3377) or HEP$\pm$GPI (n=3609) as procedural
              anticoagulation. Outcomes of interest included bleeding,
              transfusions, death, and hospital length of stay (LOS). To
              control for patient and hospital-level characteristics,
              propensity score-matching (PSM) analyses were performed. RESULTS:
              Mortality, clinically apparent bleeding, clinically apparent
              bleeding requiring transfusion, any transfusions, and LOS were
              all lower in patients treated with BIV as compared with patients
              treated with HEP$\pm$GPI. After PSM, the rate of transfusion was
              significantly lower with BIV (odds ratio: 0.57, 95\% confidence
              interval: 0.34-0.96), and the hospital LOS was significantly
              shorter in patients treated with BIV compared with those treated
              with HEP$\pm$GPI (0.9$\pm$2.0 vs 1.2$\pm$2.3 days, P<0.0001).
              CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing PCI and treated with
              prasugrel, the use of BIV rather than HEP$\pm$GPI is associated
              with significantly lower transfusion rate and LOS. These results

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The authors aim to determine whether pediatric
              residents used DSM-IV criteria to diagnose major depressive
              disorder and how this related to residents' confidence in
              diagnosis and treatment skills before and after clinical training
              with depressed adolescents. METHODS: Pediatric residents
              evaluated two different standardized patients portraying major
              depressive disorder before and after learning about adolescent
              depression. Residents' interactions with standardized patients
              were observed, and checklists containing DSM-IV criteria for
              major depressive disorder and other pertinent information, such
              as comorbidities, were completed for each interaction. After the
              encounter, residents completed a survey asking about the
              ``patient's'' diagnosis and the residents' confidence in their
              clinical skills. RESULTS: Residents assessed significantly more
              checklist items in the second encounter with a standardized
              patient. Residents' confidence in treatment was significantly
              higher after the rotation, while confidence in diagnostic skills
              was unchanged, remaining high. Even after the rotation, residents
              did not use all DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder in
              their diagnoses. CONCLUSION: Major depressive disorder is a
              common adolescent psychiatric disorder. Pediatricians must be
              equipped with appropriate interpersonal and diagnostic skills to
              detect this and other psychiatric disorders. Standardized
              patients represent one useful way to teach and assess these
              skills. This study suggests that residents' interpersonal and
              diagnostic skills can improve with practice. Although resident
              scores improved, post-encounter checklists showed that residents
              were still not asking all the necessary questions for a DSM-IV
              diagnosis, concluding prematurely that the standardized patients
              had major depressive disorder before satisfying all diagnostic
              criteria. The majority did not consider other depressive
              conditions or comorbid disorders.",

              (2169 patients received anticoagulation and 2194 antiplatelet
              therapy) were included. All of the studies compared adjusted-dose
              warfarin or with aspirin, and the majority of the patients were
              >70 years of age. Anticoagulants were titrated to an
              international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 4.5, and aspirin
              was administered at a dosage of 75 to 325 mg/d. Death occurred in
              206 participants treated with an anticoagulant and 229
              participants treated with antiplatelet therapy. There was no
              significant difference in the overall stroke rate between the
              groups (OR = 0.667, 95\% CI 0.426-1.045, P = 0.08); however,
              patients with nonrheumatic AF (NRAF) treated with an
              anticoagulant had a lower risk of stroke (OR = 0.557, 95\% CI
              0.411-0.753, P < 0.001). Anticoagulants were associated with a
              lower risk of embolism (OR = 0.616, 95\% CI = 0.392-0.966, P =
              0.04), and this finding persisted in patients with NRAF (OR =
              0.581, 95\% CI 0.359-0.941, P = 0.03). No significant difference
              in the rate of hemorrhage/major bleeding was noted (OR = 1.497,
              95\% CI 0.730-3.070, P = 0.27), and this finding persisted on
              subgroup analysis. Anticoagulants appear to be more effective
              than aspirin in preventing embolisms in patients with AF, as the
              risk of bleeding is not increased.",

              mental health services in mapping this problem. Further, it is
              not clear whether usual care in such services can be improved via

              such intervention, found to be effective and easily learned
              amongst novice clinicians, is Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT).
              The study described in the current paper has two main objectives.
              First, it aims to investigate the impact on clinical care of
              implementing Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Adolescents for the
              treatment of adolescent depression within a rural mental health
              service compared with Treatment as Usual (TAU). The second
              objective is to record the process and challenges (i.e.
              feasibility, acceptability, sustainability) associated with
              implementing and evaluating an evidence-based intervention within
              a community service. This paper outlines the study rationale and
              design for this community based research trial. METHODS/DESIGN:
              The study involves a cluster randomisation trial to be conducted
              within a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service in rural
              Australia. All clinicians in the service will be invited to
              participate. Participating clinicians will be randomised via
              block design at each of four sites to (a) training and delivery
              of IPT, or (b) TAU. The primary measure of impact on care will be
              a clinically significant change in depressive symptomatology,
              with secondary outcomes involving treatment satisfaction and
              changes in other symptomatology. Participating adolescents with
              significant depressive symptomatology, aged 12 to 18 years, will
              complete assessment measures at Weeks 0, 12 and 24 of treatment.
              They will also complete a depression inventory once a month
              during that period. This study aims to recruit 60 adolescent
              participants and their parent/guardian/s. A power analysis is not
              indicated as an intra-class correlation coefficient will be
              calculated and used to inform sample size calculations for
              subsequent large-scale trials. Qualitative data regarding process
              implementation will be collected quarterly from focus groups with
              participating clinicians over 18 months, plus phone interviews
              with participating adolescents and parent/guardians at 12 weeks
              and 24 weeks of treatment. The focus group qualitative data will
              be analysed using a Fourth Generation Evaluation methodology that
              includes a constant comparative cyclic analysis method.
              DISCUSSION: This study protocol will be informative for
              researchers and clinicians interested in considering, designing

              Type 2 studies whereas the adolescent protocols meet criteria for

              Interpersonal Therapy-Adolescent, which falls under the

              efficacy of dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban to warfarin for
              the management of atrial fibrillation (AF) in older adults. The
              prevalence and incidence of AF increase with age. Approximately 5
              \% of the United States population over the age of sixty-five
              years and 10 \% over the age of seventy-nine years have AF. AF is
              associated with increased risk for thromboembolic events. Despite
              the increasing incidence and prevalence of AF in older adults and
              the risks of thromboembolic events, clinicians often avoid
              anticoagulants. Specifically with warfarin, the risk of
              hemorrhage may outweigh the benefit in stroke risk reduction in
              certain populations. Aspirin, while safer to use, is not as
              effective as warfarin in stroke risk reduction. Newer non-vitamin
              K dependent antithrombotic therapies (e.g. dabigatran,
              rivaroxaban, and apixaban) are redefining thromboprophylaxis of
              AF. Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban are at least as
              effective as warfarin in stroke risk reduction. With new
              mechanisms of action and no need for therapeutic drug monitoring,
              countless new patients are potential candidates for
              anticoagulation. However patient adherence, lack of a reversal
              agent, cost, and other safety concerns remain reasons for caution
              and careful consideration. Furthermore, older adults exhibited
              greater adverse effects from these agents across the clinical
              trials. This review will examine the newer anticoagulants safety
              and efficacy with particular attention to their role in treating
              older adults with AF. Alternatives to warfarin therapy now exist
              for thromboprophylaxis of AF. Whether these agents represent
              advances in overall safety in older adults remains uncertain.
              More experience and research are needed before endorsing their
              widespread use as a replacement for warfarin in the geriatric

  author   = "Thombs, Brett D and Roseman, Michelle and Kloda, Lorie A",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Depression is an important cause of disability among
              children and adolescents. Depression screening is one possible
              method for managing depression, and screening programs have been
              initiated in some school and medical settings. However, in 2005,
              the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care and the United
              Kingdom National Institute of Clinical Excellence did not
              recommend depression screening among children and adolescents. By
              contrast, in 2009, the United States Preventive Services Task
              Force recommended that all adolescents, but not younger children,
              be screened for depression in medical settings with integrated
              depression management services, although no trials of screening
              were identified. The objectives of this systematic review are to
              evaluate in children and adolescents the accuracy of depression
              screening tools; depression treatment efficacy; whether
              depression screening improves depression outcomes; and potential
              harms related to depression interventions and screening.
              METHODS/DESIGN: Data sources will include the bibliographic
              databases MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, LILACS and
              Web of Science, supplemented by reference harvesting of eligible
              articles, relevant systematic reviews, relevant guidelines and
              recommendations, and selected journals, and by searches for
              unpublished studies. Eligible studies will report data for
              children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years. Eligible diagnostic
              accuracy studies must compare a depression screening tool to a
              validated diagnostic interview for major depressive disorder and
              report diagnostic accuracy data. Eligible treatment studies must
              be randomized controlled trials of pharmacological,
              psychotherapeutic, or other depression treatments commonly
              available for children and adolescents in pediatric,
              primary-care, and family medicine settings. Eligible screening
              studies must be randomized controlled trials that compare
              depression outcomes between children or adolescents who underwent
              depression screening versus those who did not. Studies of harms
              will include randomized controlled trials and observational
              studies that evaluate harms from depression screening or
              treatment. Two investigators will independently review titles and
              abstracts, followed by full article review. Disagreements will be
              resolved by consensus. Two investigators will independently
              extract the data, with discrepancies resolved via consensus.
              DISCUSSION: The proposed systematic review will determine whether
              there is sufficient evidence of benefits in excess of harms and

               and risk of suicide. The majority of depressed youth, however,
               are undiagnosed and untreated, despite opportunities for
               identification in settings such as primary care., We sought to
               assess the health effects of routine primary care screening for
               Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) among children and adolescents
               ages 7 to 18 years, including evaluating the accuracy of
               screening tests and the risks and benefits of treatment with
               psychotherapy and/or SSRIs., We developed an analytic framework
               and five key questions to represent the logical evidence
               connecting primary care screening to improved health outcomes.
               We conducted a series of literature searches for each key
               question in Medline, the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled
               Trials, PsycInfo, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic
               Reviews through May 2007. We also reviewed studies included in
               recent systematic evidence reviews and meta-analyses, contacted
               experts, and reviewed bibliographies from relevant studies. We
               examined 5,737 abstracts and 480 full text articles. One
               reviewer abstracted relevant information from each included
               article into standardized evidence tables. A second reviewer
               checked key elements. Two reviewers quality graded each article
               using US Preventive Services Task Force criteria. Due to
               heterogeneity among studies, we conducted qualitative syntheses
               for studies of screening test accuracy and for the benefits and
               harms of psychotherapeutic treatment interventions. For SSRI
               trials, we quantitatively pooled results for absolute risk
               differences for response rates and suicide-related adverse
               effects, using random effects models, and describe findings of
               other systematic reviews., No controlled trials compared health
               outcomes in screened and unscreened pediatric populations. Data
               from six fair-quality studies evaluating the accuracy of
               screening instruments among 2,781 adolescents in primary care or
               school settings report sensitivity of 73 to 100 percent and
               specificity of 65 to 94 percent. Three studies including
               participants less than 12 years old yielded sensitivities of 53
               to 90 percent and specificities of 49 to 96 percent. Pooled risk
               difference (RD) for response rates among nine fair- or
               good-quality, double-blinded, placebo-controlled RCTs evaluating
               short-term efficacy of SSRIs among 1,972 children and
               adolescents yielded a higher response rate among treated youth
               (RD 12 percent, 95 percent confidence interval (CI) 7, 16). Ten
               fair- or good-quality RCTs evaluated short-term efficacy of
               psychotherapy among 757 children or adolescents aged 9 to 18
               years. Most psychotherapy trials demonstrated an improvement in
               depression symptoms based on proportion achieving remission,
               change in mean depression score, or improved global functioning.
               Treatment with SSRIs was associated with a small increased risk
               of suicidality (RD 1 percent, 95 percent CI 0, 2). Suicidality
               includes suicidal ideation, preparatory acts, or attempts. No
               suicide deaths have occurred in controlled trials of SSRIs.
               Observational data are inconclusive., Although no trials of
               screening for pediatric MDD were identified, limited available
               data suggest that primary care feasible screening tools may be
               accurate in identifying depressed adolescents, and treatment can
               improve depression outcomes. Treating depressed youth with SSRIs
               may be associated with a small increased risk of suicidality and
               therefore should only be considered if judicious clinical
               monitoring is possible. Specific treatment should be based on

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Depressive disorders often begin during childhood or
              adolescence. There is a growing body of evidence supporting
              effective treatments during the acute phase of a depressive
              disorder. However, little is known about treatments for
              preventing relapse or recurrence of depression once an individual
              has achieved remission or recovery from their symptoms.
              OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy of early interventions,
              including psychological and pharmacological interventions, to
              prevent relapse or recurrence of depressive disorders in children
              and adolescents. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane
              Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised
              Register (CCDANCTR) (to 1 June 2011). The CCDANCTR contains
              reports of relevant randomised controlled trials from The
              Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE
              (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). In addition we
              handsearched the references of all included studies and review
              articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials using
              a psychological or pharmacological intervention, with the aim of
              preventing relapse or recurrence from an episode of major
              depressive disorder (MDD) or dysthymic disorder (DD) in children
              and adolescents were included. Participants were required to have
              been diagnosed with MDD or DD according to DSM or ICD criteria,
              using a standardised and validated assessment tool. DATA
              COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently
              assessed all trials for inclusion in the review, extracted trial
              and outcome data, and assessed trial quality. Results for
              dichotomous outcomes are expressed as odds ratio and continuous
              measures as mean difference or standardised mean difference. We
              combined results using random-effects meta-analyses, with 95\%
              confidence intervals. We contacted lead authors of included
              trials and requested additional data where possible. MAIN
              RESULTS: Nine trials with 882 participants were included in the
              review. In five trials the outcome assessors were blind to the
              participants' intervention condition and in the remainder of
              trials it was unclear. In the majority of trials, participants
              were either not blind to their intervention condition, or it was
              unclear whether they were or not. Allocation concealment was also
              unclear in the majority of trials. Although all trials treated
              participants in an outpatient setting, the designs implemented in
              trials was diverse, which limits the generalisability of the
              results. Three trials indicated participants treated with
              antidepressant medication had lower relapse-recurrence rates
              (40.9\%) compared to those treated with placebo (66.6\%) during a
              relapse prevention phase (odds ratio (OR) 0.34; 95\% confidence
              interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.64, P = 0.02). One trial that compared a
              combination of psychological therapy and medication to medication
              alone favoured a combination approach over medication alone,
              however this result did not reach statistical significance (OR
              0.26; 95\% CI 0.06 to 1.15). The majority of trials that involved
              antidepressant medication reported adverse events including
              suicide-related behaviours. However, there were not enough data
              to show which treatment approach results in the most favourable
              adverse event profile. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Currently, there is
              little evidence to conclude which type of treatment approach is
              most effective in preventing relapse or recurrence of depressive
              episodes in children and adolescents. Limited trials found that
              antidepressant medication reduces the chance of
              relapse-recurrence in the future, however, there is considerable
              diversity in the design of trials, making it difficult to compare
              outcomes across studies. Some of the research involving
              psychological therapies is encouraging, however at present more
              trials with larger sample sizes need to be conducted in order to
              explore this treatment approach further.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To determine if there is improvement in medication
              management when pharmacists and family physicians collaborate to
              prescribe medication renewals requested by fax. DESIGN:
              Prospective, non-randomized controlled trial. SETTING: W est
              Winds Primary Health Centre, an interdisciplinary health centre
              that includes an academic family medicine practice, located in
              Saskatoon, Sask. PARTICIPANTS: All patients whose pharmacies
              faxed the health centre requesting prescription renewals between
              October 2007 and February 2008 were selected to participate in
              the study. INTERVENTIONS: Medication renewal requests were
              forwarded to the pharmacist (who works in the clinic part-time)
              on days when he was working (intervention group). The pharmacist
              assessed drug-therapy issues that might preclude safe and
              effective prescribing of the medication. The pharmacist and
              physician then made a collaborative decision to authorize the
              requested medication or to request additional interventions first
              (eg, perform laboratory tests). When the pharmacist was not
              working, the physicians managed the renewal requests
              independently (control group). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Medication
              renewals authorized with no recommendations, medication-related
              problems identified, new monitoring tests ordered, and new
              appointments scheduled with health providers. RESULTS: A total of
              181 renewal requests were included (94 in the control group and
              87 in the intervention group). The control group had
              significantly more requests authorized with no recommendations
              (75.5\% vs 52.9\%, P = .001). Those in the intervention group had
              significantly more medication-related problems identified (26 vs
              10, P = .031); medication changes made (24 vs 10, P = .044); and
              new appointments scheduled with their family physicians (31 vs
              21, P = .049). CONCLUSION: There is an improvement in medication
              management when a pharmacist collaborates with family physicians
              to prescribe medication renewals. The collaborative model created
              significantly more activity with each renewal request (ie,
              identification of medication-related problems, medication
              changes, and new appointments), which reflects an improvement in
              the process of care.",

  abstract = "The power and influence of receptionists in general practice has
              been the subject of little research. We argue that the structural
              position of receptionists and the nature of primary medical care
              give receptionists a potential discretionary role in determining
              access to the general practitioner. A major criterion for access
              is the imputed urgency of the patient's condition, which
              frequently involves the receptionist making a medical assessment
              based on only a brief verbal exchange. The paper draws on
              interviews with a sample of over 1000 adults about their
              experiences of the reception process in general practice. The
              receptionist's role in the following areas is examined; delay in
              obtaining appointments, asking the reason for surgery
              consultations and home visits, reducing the number of home visits
              by suggesting patients attend the surgery, putting patients
              through to speak to the doctor on the telephone and giving health
              advice. Patients who have experienced receptionists as an active
              intermediary are more likely to report interaction difficulties
              with receptionists. The survey data lend support to two major
              findings: (1) that as practices become larger and more complex
              receptionists operate with more rigid rules, leading to greater
              hostility expressed by patients towards reception staff; and (2)
              parents with dependent children and young adults express more
              antagonism, because they are more likely to experience the
              receptionist as a `gatekeeper' with whom they need to negotiate

              advocate more training to improve their performance and,
              consequently, the patient experience. AIM: To explore the
              complexity of the role of general practice receptionists by
              considering the wider practice context in which they work. DESIGN
              AND SETTING: Ethnographic observation in seven urban general
              practices in the north-west of England. METHOD: Seven researchers
              conducted 200 hours of ethnographic observation, predominantly in
              the reception areas of each practice. Forty-five receptionists
              were involved in the study and were asked about their work as
              they carried out their activities. Observational notes were
              taken. Analysis involved ascribing codes to incidents considered
              relevant to the role and organising these into related clusters.
              RESULTS: Receptionists were faced with the difficult task of
              prioritising patients, despite having little time, information,
              and training. They felt responsible for protecting those patients
              who were most vulnerable, however this was sometimes made
              difficult by protocols set by the GPs and by patients trying to
              'play' the system. CONCLUSION: Framing the receptionist-patient
              encounter as one between the 'powerful' and the 'vulnerable' gets
              in the way of fully understanding the complex tasks receptionists
              perform and the contradictions that are inherent in their role.
              Calls for more training, without reflective attention to practice

              needs in order to improve both access and patient care.
              DISCUSSION: Five common appointment strategies have emerged
              through the work of the Australian Primary Care Collaboratives:
              open access, book on the day, supersaturate, carve out and
              advanced access systems. All these systems have advantages and
              disadvantages and may suit different practices depending on their
              contexts and populations. It is helpful to measure how effective
              the current practice approach is in dealing with delay and
              delivering satisfaction. Specific approaches such as 'appointment
              golf' and 'jeopardy doctor' may help improve system functioning.

              appointments, which are booked in advance of a given workday; and
              2) same-day appointments, which are booked as calls come during
              the workday. The challenge for practices is to provide preferred
              time slots for prescheduled appointments and yet see as many
              same-day patients as possible during regular work hours. It is
              also important, to the extent possible, to match same-day
              patients with their own providers (so as to maximize continuity
              of care). In this paper, we present a mathematical framework (a
              stochastic dynamic program) for same-day patient allocation in
              multi-physician practices in which calls for same-day
              appointments come in dynamically over a workday. Allocation
              decisions have to be made in the presence of prescheduled
              appointments and without complete demand information. The
              objective is to maximize a weighted measure that includes the
              number of same-day patients seen during regular work hours as
              well as the continuity provided to these patients. Our
              experimental design is motivated by empirical data we collected
              at a 3-provider family medicine practice in Massachusetts. Our
              results show that the location of prescheduled appointments -
              i.e. where in the day these appointments are booked - has a
              significant impact on the number of same-day patients a practice
              can see during regular work hours, as well as the continuity the
              practice is able to provide. We find that a 2-Blocks policy which
              books prescheduled appointments in two clusters - early morning
              and early afternoon - works very well. We also provide a simple,

  abstract = "At the point of entry to the health care system sit general
              practice receptionists (GPRs), a seldom studied employment group.
              The place of the receptionist involves both a location within the
              internal geography of the clinic and a position within the
              primary care team. Receptionists literally 'receive' those who
              phone or enter the clinic, and are a critical influence in their
              transformation from a 'person' to a 'patient'. This process
              occurs in a particular space: the 'waiting room'. We explore the
              waiting room and its dynamics in terms of 'acceptability', an
              under-examined aspect of access to primary care. We ask 'How do
              GPRs see their role with regard to patients with complex health
              and social needs, in light of the spatio-temporal constraints of
              their working environments?' We engaged receptionists as
              participants to explore perceptions of their roles and their
              workspaces, deriving narrative data from three focus groups
              involving 14 GPRs from 11 practices in the Northland region of
              New Zealand. The study employed an adapted form of grounded
              theory. Our findings indicate that GPRs are on the edge of the
              practice team, yet carry a complex role at the frontline, in the
              waiting space. They are de facto managers of this space; however,
              they have limited agency within general practice settings, due to
              the constraints imposed upon them by physical and organisational
              structures. The agency of GPRs is most evident in their ability
              to shape the social dynamics of the waiting space, and to frame
              the health care experience as positive for people whose usual
              experience is marginalisation. We conclude that, if well
              supported, receptionists have the potential to positively
              influence health care acceptability, and patients' access to
              care.",

              measurement--knowing which quality aspects should be measured and
              in what ways. This article aims to assess service quality
              measurement by focusing on general practice appointment systems.
              DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The authors use a case study,
              integrating qualitative and quantitative methods, including
              interviews with stakeholders as well as data regarding
              appointment systems' temporal aspects. FINDINGS: This study
              offers insights into service quality's subjective and
              context-dependent nature, as reflected in primary healthcare
              stakeholder perceptions and service quality's objective and
              quantifiable aspects, revealing its dynamic, process-based
              nature. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: The empirical approach
              to service quality measurement did not focus on all general
              practice service quality aspects, but instead focused on patient
              appointments with healthcare professionals. Broader applications
              to include other service quality aspects should be addressed by
              research. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Using one approach, service
              operators could have a tool for obtaining a more complex and
              richer service quality picture, leading to a better understanding
              of the relationship between service delivery and its evaluations
              by different stakeholders. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The service quality
              measurement method offers innovative insights into different
              theoretical abstractions, constructively challenges both
              measurement and service quality, whilst moving beyond managerial
              and user-based approaches, and is highly relevant to contemporary

              studies are a controversial, but potentially useful, approach to
              take when conducting health services research. AIM: To
              investigate the construct validity of survey questions relating
              to access to primary care included in the English GP Patient
              Survey. DESIGN AND SETTING: Observational study in 41 general
              practices in rural, urban, and inner-city settings in the UK.
              METHOD: Between May 2010 and March 2011, researchers telephoned
              practices at monthly intervals, simulating patients requesting
              routine, but prompt, appointments. Seven measures of access and
              appointment availability, measured from the mystery-shopper
              contacts, were related to seven measures of practice performance
              from the GP Patient Survey. RESULTS: Practices with lower access
              scores in the GP Patient Survey had poorer access and appointment
              availability for five out of seven items measured directly, when
              compared with practices that had higher scores. Scores on items
              from the national survey that related to appointment availability
              were significantly associated with direct measures of appointment
              availability. Patient-satisfaction levels and the likelihood that
              patients would recommend their practice were related to the
              availability of appointments. Patients' reports of ease of
              telephone access in the national survey were unrelated to three
              out of four measures of practice call handling, but were related
              to the time taken to resolve an appointment request, suggesting
              responders' possible confusion in answering this question.
              CONCLUSION: Items relating to the accessibility of care in a the
              English GP patient survey have construct validity. Patients'
              satisfaction with their practice is not related to practice call
              handling, but is related to appointment availability.",

              provider type and its relation to family physicians. OBJECTIVES:
              To review the hospitalist literature to understand the
              hospitalist role, identify benefits and risks of the hospitalist
              model to family physicians, and discuss future opportunities to
              study and work with hospitalists. METHODS: An integrative review
              of published literature about the hospitalist model focused on
              the influence of hospitalists on family practice. RESULTS: Three
              main themes were identified as interest areas for family
              physicians: descriptions of the hospitalist role and
              responsibilities; hypothesized benefits and risks of the
              hospitalist model; and reported research results evaluating the
              effect of the hospitalist model. Two major opportunities related
              to hospitalists and family physicians were also uncovered:
              opportunities to conduct future research to study the influence
              of hospitalists on family physicians; and opportunities to create
              workable relationships with these new practitioners. CONCLUSIONS:
              Despite some opposition to hospitalist programs, the economic
              climate and increasing productivity standards suggest that these
              programs are here for the foreseeable future, and it is in family
              physicians' best interests to understand the opportunities and
              risks of the hospitalist model. Family physicians can work
              proactively with this new patient care model by participating in
              the development of standardized and efficient ways to communicate
              and to partner with hospitalists. Meanwhile, future research

              it provided, resulting in increased patient encounters and

              the efficacy of the web-based appointment system in the
              registration service for outpatients. METHODS: Data from the
              web-based appointment system in Xijing hospital from January to
              December 2010 were collected using a stratified random sampling
              method, from which participants were randomly selected for a
              telephone interview asking for detailed information on using the
              system. Patients who registered through registration windows were
              randomly selected as a comparison group, and completed a
              questionnaire on-site. RESULTS: A total of 5641 patients using
              the online booking service were available for data analysis. Of
              them, 500 were randomly selected, and 369 (73.8\%) completed a
              telephone interview. Of the 500 patients using the usual queuing
              method who were randomly selected for inclusion in the study,
              responses were obtained from 463, a response rate of 92.6\%.
              Between the two registration methods, there were significant
              differences in age, degree of satisfaction, and total waiting
              time (P0.05). Being ignorant of online registration, not trusting
              the internet, and a lack of ability to use a computer were three
              main reasons given for not using the web-based appointment
              system. The overall proportion of non-attendance was 14.4\% for
              those using the web-based appointment system, and the
              non-attendance rate was significantly different among different
              hospital departments, day of the week, and time of the day
              (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Compared to the usual queuing method, the
              web-based appointment system could significantly increase
              patient's satisfaction with registration and reduce total waiting

              barriers and facilitators for providing online access to their
              records and services for primary care workers; and their
              association with organisational/IT system issues. Setting Primary
              care. Participants A total of 143 studies were included. 17 were
              experimental in design and subject to risk of bias assessment,
              which is reported in a separate paper. Detailed inclusion and
              exclusion criteria have also been published elsewhere in the
              protocol. Primary and secondary outcome measures Our primary
              outcome measure was change in quality or safety as a result of
              implementation or utilisation of online records/transactional
              services. Results No studies reported changes in health outcomes;
              though eight detected medication errors and seven reported
              improved uptake of preventative care. Professional concerns over
              privacy were reported in 14 studies. 18 studies reported concern
              over potential increased workload; with some showing an increase
              workload in email or online messaging; telephone contact
              remaining unchanged, and face-to face contact staying the same or
              falling. Owing to heterogeneity in reporting overall workload
              change was hard to predict. 10 studies reported how online access
              offered convenience, primarily for more advantaged patients, who
              were largely highly satisfied with the process when clinician
              responses were prompt. Conclusions Patient online access and
              services offer increased convenience and satisfaction. However,
              professionals were concerned about impact on workload and risk to
              privacy. Studies correcting medication errors may improve patient
              safety. There may need to be a redesign of the business process
              to engage health professionals in online access and of the EHR to
              make it friendlier and provide equity of access to a wider group

              problems of electronic communication with patients. METHODS:
              University and college health centers were surveyed about the
              type of utilization and policies of electronic communication with
              patients. The survey group consisted of 99 health centers
              predominantly serving students representing small-, medium-, and
              large-sized public and private colleges and universities.
              Eighty-nine health centers completed the survey. RESULTS: Of the
              responding health centers, 63.6\% use some form of electronic
              communication with patients. Twenty-seven percent of the health
              centers give out some form of medical advice via E-mail or the
              Internet; 14.7\% give out some laboratory results via E-mail;
              3.4\% make appointments via E-mail; and 63.6\% give out
              administrative advice by E-mail. While there was consistent
              concern expressed about confidentiality and security, only five
              health centers had a policy about electronic communication. Uses
              were most common in nonclinical areas but did include health
              education, Web sites, medical advice, laboratory results,
              appointment-making or confirmation, and contacting hard-to-reach
              patients including those studying abroad. CONCLUSIONS: While
              electronic communication with patients was common, provision of
              direct medical advice was less common. Issues receiving little
              attention include determining the types of electronic

              community Primary Care Network (PCN) clinic., Design: Eight
              providers and their staff and patients were surveyed on use of
              this web messaging system, and physician productivity was
              measured with Relative Value Unit (RVU) and office visit data.,
              Results: 36.9\% (238/645) of registered users responded to the
              survey. The web messaging system was preferred over phone calls
              by both providers and patients for the communication of
              non-urgent problems. A great majority of patients found it easy
              to use (88.8\% or 206/232) and were satisfied (85.8\% or
              199/232). Satisfaction was significantly associated with timely
              provider response (Goodman-Kruskal Gamma = 0.667, 95\% CI =

              health-related apps. A 2012 estimate puts the number of
              health-related apps at no fewer than 40,000, as healthcare
              professionals and consumers continue to express concerns about
              the quality of many apps, calling for some form of app regulatory
              control or certification to be put in place. We describe the
              range of apps on offer as of 2013, and then present a brief
              survey of evaluation studies of medical and health-related apps
              that have been conducted to date, covering a range of clinical
              disciplines and topics. Our survey includes studies that
              highlighted risks, negative issues and worrying deficiencies in
              existing apps. We discuss the concept of `apps as a medical
              device' and the relevant regulatory controls that apply in USA
              and Europe, offering examples of apps that have been formally
              approved using these mechanisms. We describe the online Health
              Apps Library run by the National Health Service in England and
              the calls for a vetted medical and health app store. We discuss
              the ingredients for successful apps beyond the rather narrow
              definition of `apps as a medical device'. These ingredients cover
              app content quality, usability, the need to match apps to
              consumers' general and health literacy levels, device
              connectivity standards (for apps that connect to glucometers,
              blood pressure monitors, etc.), as well as app security and user
              privacy. `Happtique Health App Certification Program' (HACP), a
              voluntary app certification scheme, successfully captures most of
              these desiderata, but is solely focused on apps targeting the US
              market. HACP, while very welcome, is in ways reminiscent of the
              early days of the Web, when many ``similar'' quality benchmarking
              tools and codes of conduct for information publishers were
              proposed to appraise and rate online medical and health
              information. It is probably impossible to rate and police every
              app on offer today, much like in those early days of the Web,
              when people quickly realised the same regarding informational Web
              pages. The best first line of defence was, is, and will always be
              to educate consumers regarding the potentially harmful content of
              (some) apps.",

              in women with endometrial cancer undergoing robotic-assisted
              surgery. METHODS: During the first two years of the robotic
              surgery program, we prospectively collected data concerning
              patient demographics and surgical outcomes. At the first
              postoperative visit (21 to 28 days after surgery), all
              participants completed a HRQoL questionnaire. We examined the
              association between BMI and age, as well as the different areas
              of HRQoL, using chi-square and ANOVA. RESULTS: Of 109
              participants, 41 were 70 years of age or older, and 51 had a BMI
              of 30 kg/m(2) or more. Following surgery, the mean ($\pm$SD)
              duration of hospital stay was 1.9 $\pm$ 1.5 days, and reported
              pain level was highest on the second postoperative day, with a
              mean score of 3.4 $\pm$ 2.1 on a seven-point scale. Moreover, two
              thirds of women reported no pain by the first postoperative
              visit, and only 18.2\% of women aged 70 years or older used any
              narcotic for pain control. These results indicated that there was
              little influence of the surgery on HRQoL, and women resumed
              typical activities within an average of 11 days after surgery.
              Lastly, participants' average rating of satisfaction was 6.7 on a

              the use of powered wheelchairs, have difficulty completing basic
              maneuvering tasks during their activities of daily living (ADL).
              In order to provide assistance to this population, robotic and
              intelligent system technologies have been used to design an
              intelligent powered wheelchair (IPW). This paper provides a
              comprehensive overview of the design and validation of the IPW.
              METHODS: The main contributions of this work are three-fold.
              First, we present a software architecture for robot navigation
              and control in constrained spaces. Second, we describe a
              decision-theoretic approach for achieving robust speech-based
              control of the intelligent wheelchair. Third, we present an
              evaluation protocol motivated by a meaningful clinical outcome,
              in the form of the Robotic Wheelchair Skills Test (RWST). This
              allows us to perform a thorough characterization of the
              performance and safety of the system, involving 17 test subjects
              (8 non-PW users, 9 regular PW users), 32 complete RWST sessions,
              25 total hours of testing, and 9 kilometers of total running
              distance. RESULTS: User tests with the RWST show that the
              navigation architecture reduced collisions by more than 60\%
              compared to other recent intelligent wheelchair platforms. On the
              tasks of the RWST, we measured an average decrease of 4\% in
              performance score and 3\% in safety score (not statistically
              significant), compared to the scores obtained with conventional
              driving model. This analysis was performed with regular users
              that had over 6 years of wheelchair driving experience, compared
              to approximately one half-hour of training with the autonomous
              mode. CONCLUSIONS: The platform tested in these experiments is
              among the most experimentally validated robotic wheelchairs in
              realistic contexts. The results establish that proficient powered
              wheelchair users can achieve the same level of performance with
              the intelligent command mode, as with the conventional command
              mode.",

  abstract = "Motor learning often involves situations in which the
              somatosensory targets of movement are, at least initially, poorly
              defined, as for example, in learning to speak or learning the
              feel of a proper tennis serve. Under these conditions, motor
              skill acquisition presumably requires perceptual as well as motor
              learning. That is, it engages both the progressive shaping of
              sensory targets and associated changes in motor performance. In
              the present study, we test the idea that perceptual learning
              alters somatosensory function and in so doing produces changes to
              human motor performance and sensorimotor adaptation. Subjects in
              these experiments undergo perceptual training in which a robotic
              device passively moves the subject's arm on one of a set of
              fan-shaped trajectories. Subjects are required to indicate
              whether the robot moved the limb to the right or the left and
              feedback is provided. Over the course of training both the
              perceptual boundary and acuity are altered. The perceptual
              learning is observed to improve both the rate and extent of
              learning in a subsequent sensorimotor adaptation task and the
              benefits persist for at least 24 h. The improvement in the
              present studies varies systematically with changes in perceptual
              acuity and is obtained regardless of whether the perceptual
              boundary shift serves to systematically increase or decrease
              error on subsequent movements. The beneficial effects of
              perceptual training are found to be substantially dependent on
              reinforced decision-making in the sensory domain.
              Passive-movement training on its own is less able to alter
              subsequent learning in the motor system. Overall, this study
              suggests perceptual learning plays an integral role in motor

              modality in speech production, somatosensory information plays a
              role that extends from brainstem responses to cortical control.
              Accordingly, the motor commands that underlie speech movements
              may have somatosensory as well as auditory goals. Here we provide
              evidence that, independent of the acoustics, somatosensory

              speech movements. We were able to dissociate auditory and

  abstract = "Equifinality, during arm reaching movements, relates to the
              capacity of the neuromuscular system to attain the same final
              position in the presence or absence of transient perturbations.
              There have been several controversies regarding equifinality in
              the literature. A brief elastic perturbation, applied during a
              fast arm movement or just before its initiation, typically does
              not affect final arm position. On the other hand, several
              experiments have shown that velocity-dependent perturbations,
              such as Coriolis force or negative damping, while transient in
              nature, have a significant effect on final arm position when
              compared to unperturbed movements. In this study, an unloading
              paradigm was used to study the role of reflexes with respect to
              equifinality. The effects on final arm position of suddenly
              decreasing a static load maintained by fourteen subjects were
              analyzed. Subjects maintained an initial load produced by a
              double-joint manipulandum moving in the horizontal plane. The
              load was suddenly decreased, either in one or in two successive
              steps with different time intervals, resulting in a rapid
              reflex-mediated change in arm position. Unloading led to
              short-latency changes in the activity of shoulder and elbow
              muscles and significant variations in tonic activity. It was
              found that the final hand position was shorter for double- versus
              single-step unloading if the time between two successive changes
              in load was greater than 100 ms. With a shorter time interval,
              the final hand positions were the same. This difference in final
              hand positions was inversely proportional to the hand velocity at
              the time of the second change in load. Further,
              agonist/antagonist co-activation increased in double-step
              unloading. Thus, the change in both the load and the movement
              velocity may influence the magnitude of the unloading reflex.
              This may be indicative of a dependence of stretch reflexes on
              velocity. Perturbation may cause a reflex-mediated increase in
              joint stiffness, which could explain why equifinality is not
              preserved after some perturbations, such as velocity-dependant
              external forces.",

              point in space, a cloud of final limb positions is observed
              around the target. Previously we noted that patterns of
              variability at the end of movement to a circular target were not
              circular, but instead reflected patterns of limb stiffness-in
              directions where limb stiffness was high, variability in end
              position was low, and vice versa. Here we examine the
              determinants of variability at movement end in more detail. To do
              this, we have subjects move the handle of a robotic device from
              different starting positions into a circular target. We use
              position servocontrolled displacements of the robot's handle to
              measure limb stiffness at the end of movement and we also record
              patterns of end position variability. To examine the effect of
              change in posture on movement variability, we use a visual motor
              transformation in which we change the limb configuration and also
              the actual movement target, while holding constant the visual
              display. We find that, regardless of movement direction, patterns
              of variability at the end of movement vary systematically with
              limb configuration and are also related to patterns of limb
              stiffness, which are likewise configuration dependent. The result
              suggests that postural configuration determines the base level of

              bypass surgery, minimally invasive cardiac surgery, and robotic
              surgery have also changed the face of cardiac anaesthesia. The
              concept of ``Fast-track anaesthesia'' demands the use of
              nondepolarising neuromuscular blocking drugs with short duration
              of action, combining the ability to provide (if necessary)
              sufficiently profound neuromuscular blockade during surgery and
              immediate re-establishment of normal neuromuscular transmission
              at the end of surgery. Postoperative residual muscle paralysis is
              one of the major hurdles for immediate or early extubation after
              cardiac surgery. Nondepolarising neuromuscular blocking drugs for
              cardiac surgery should therefore be easy to titrate, of rapid
              onset and short duration of action with a pathway of elimination
              independent from hepatic or renal dysfunction, and should equally

  abstract = "Studies on generalization show the nature of how learning is
              encoded in the brain. Previous studies have shown rather limited
              generalization of dynamics learning across changes in movement
              direction, a finding that is consistent with the idea that
              learning is primarily local. In contrast, studies show a broader
              pattern of generalization across changes in movement amplitude,
              suggesting a more general form of learning. To understand this
              difference, we performed an experiment in which subjects held a
              robotic manipulandum and made movements to targets along the body
              midline. Subjects were trained in a velocity-dependent force
              field while moving to a 15 cm target. After training, subjects
              were tested for generalization using movements to a 30 cm target.
              We used force channels in conjunction with movements to the 30 cm
              target to assess the extent of generalization. Force channels
              restricted lateral movements and allowed us to measure force
              production during generalization. We compared actual lateral
              forces to the forces expected if dynamics learning generalized
              fully. We found that, during the test for generalization,
              subjects produced reliably less force than expected. Force
              production was appropriate for the portion of the transfer
              movement in which velocities corresponded to those experienced
              with the 15 cm target. Subjects failed to produce the expected
              forces when velocities exceeded those experienced in the training
              task. This suggests that dynamics learning generalizes little
              beyond the range of one's experience. Consistent with this
              result, subjects who trained on the 30 cm target showed full
              generalization to the 15 cm target. We performed two additional
              experiments that show that interleaved trials to the 30 cm target
              during training on the 15 cm target can resolve the difference
              between the current results and those reported previously.",

              To reconcile claims regarding the coordinate system involved in
              the representation of dynamics, we have used a procedure
              involving the transfer of force-field learning between two

              holding a two-link manipulandum. Subjects were first trained to
              make movements in a single direction at the left of the
              workspace. They were then tested for transfer of learning at the
              right of the workspace. Two groups of subjects were defined. For
              the subjects in group j, movements at the left and right
              workspace locations were matched in terms of joint displacements.
              For the subjects in group h, movements in the two locations had

              locations, whereas the subjects in group h showed poor transfer.
              These results are in agreement with the idea that new dynamics

              we in detecting them, and what does this sensitivity imply about
              the processes by which corners can be detected. In this paper we
              address both of these questions, starting with the observation
              that changing the sampling phase of a curve changes the geometry
              of its discrete trace, or the set of discrete (retinotopic)

              of dot phase, and address its theoretical explanation within a

              was to examine the role of PPC in the context of learning new
              dynamics of arm movements. We assessed this possibility by
              stimulating PPC with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
              while subjects learned to make reaching movements with their
              right hand in a velocity-dependent force field. We reasoned that,
              if PPC is necessary to adjust the trajectory of the arm as it
              interacts with a novel mechanical system, interfering with the
              functioning of PPC would impair adaptation. Single pulses of TMS
              were applied over the left PPC 40 msec after the onset of
              movement during adaptation. As a control, another group of
              subjects was stimulated over the visual cortex. During early
              stages of learning, the magnitude of the error (measured as the
              deviation of the hand paths) was similar across groups. By the
              end of the learning period, however, error magnitudes decreased
              to baseline levels for controls but remained significantly larger
              for the group stimulated over PPC. Our findings are consistent

              maintained by auditory feedback is a central idea in speech
              production research. An alternative proposal is that speech
              production is organized in terms of control signals that subserve
              movements and associated vocal-tract configurations. Indeed, the
              capacity for intelligible speech by deaf speakers suggests that
              somatosensory inputs related to movement play a role in speech
              production-but studies that might have documented a somatosensory
              component have been equivocal. For example, mechanical
              perturbations that have altered somatosensory feedback have
              simultaneously altered acoustics. Hence, any adaptation observed
              under these conditions may have been a consequence of acoustic
              change. Here we show that somatosensory information on its own is
              fundamental to the achievement of speech movements. This
              demonstration involves a dissociation of somatosensory and
              auditory feedback during speech production. Over time, subjects
              correct for the effects of a complex mechanical load that alters
              jaw movements (and hence somatosensory feedback), but which has
              no measurable or perceptible effect on acoustic output. The
              findings indicate that the positions of speech articulators and
              associated somatosensory inputs constitute a goal of speech

              bronchogenic carcinoma previously treated with external-beam

              symptomatic endobronchial bronchogenic carcinoma who had
              previously completed external irradiation were divided into two
              groups based on whether the initial bronchoscopic appearance
              showed an endoluminal mass or submucosal infiltration/extrinsic
              compression. Furthermore, patients were also classified based on
              tumor location: central (trachea or mainstem bronchi) and
              peripheral (lobar or segmental bronchi). Patients underwent three
              treatments of 800 cGy intraluminal irradiation at 2-week
              intervals, with follow-up evaluation 4 weeks later. We evaluated
              response in tumor extent based on bronchoscopic and chest
              radiograph appearance, as well as symptoms with standardized
              scales. RESULTS: Fifteen of 24 patients who underwent follow-up
              bronchoscopy had reductions in the degree of endobronchial
              obstruction. Seven of 24 patients had radiographic improvement in
              the extent of atelectasis. Patients with both tumor appearances
              (endoluminal and submucosal/extrinsic compression) had
              significant improvements following HDR-BT with regard to
              hemoptysis. Patients with submucosal disease also had improvement

  abstract = "Continuity of care is concerned with the quality of care over
              time. There are two important perspectives on this.
              Traditionally, continuity of care is idealized in the patient's
              experience of a 'continuous caring relationship' with an
              identified health care professional. For providers in vertically
              integrated systems of care, the contrasting ideal is the delivery
              of a 'seamless service' through integration, coordination and the
              sharing of information between different providers. As patients'
              health care needs can now only rarely be met by a single
              professional, multidimensional models of continuity have had to
              be developed to accommodate the possibility of achieving both
              ideals simultaneously. Continuity of care may, therefore, be
              viewed from the perspective of either patient or provider.
              Continuity in the experience of care relates conceptually to
              patients' satisfaction with both the interpersonal aspects of
              care and the coordination of that care. Experienced continuity
              may be valued in its own right. In contrast, continuity in the
              delivery of care cannot be evaluated solely through patients'
              experiences, and is related to important aspects of services such
              as 'case-management' and 'multidisciplinary team working'. From a
              provider perspective, the focus is on new models of service
              delivery and improved patient outcomes. A full consideration of
              continuity of care should therefore cover both of these distinct
              perspectives, exploring how these come together to enhance the

              verify the position of double-lumen tubes (DLT), but this remains
              controversial. The authors studied the role of bronchoscopy for
              placing and monitoring right- and left-sided DLTs after blind
              intubation and after positioning the patient. METHODS: Two
              hundred patients having thoracic surgery requiring DLT insertion
              were prospectively studied. ``Blind'' tracheal intubations were
              done with 163 left-sided and 37 right-sided disposable polyvinyl
              chloride Robertshaw tubes. Bronchoscopy was performed by a
              different anesthesiologist after intubation and conventional
              clinical verification of correct placement and after patient
              positioning for thoracotomy. A DLT was considered malpositioned
              when it had to be moved >0.5 cm to correct its position. Critical
              malpositions were those that might have affected patient safety
              or influenced the surgical procedure if left uncorrected.
              RESULTS: After ``blind'' DLT intubation, clinical evidence of
              malpositioning was found in 28 patients. This was confirmed by
              fiberoptic assessment. In 172 patients in whom placement was
              judged correct by clinical assessment, malpositioning was
              detected by bronchoscopy in 79 cases, 25 of which were critical.
              After patient positioning, DLTs were found to be displaced in 93
              patients, 48 of which were critical. Right-sided DLTs were
              significantly more likely to be malpositioned than were
              left-sided DLTs. Two complications were related to unsatisfactory
              lung separation in the 200 patients studied. CONCLUSIONS: After
              blind intubation and patient positioning, more than one third of
              DLTs required repositioning. Routine bronchoscopy is therefore
              recommended after intubation and after patient positioning.",

              According to ASA, the techniques for difficult airway management

              and successful endotracheal placement of the tube with indirect
              laryngoscopy. New intubation devices such as video laryngoscopes
              facilitate endotracheal intubation by indirect visualization of
              glottis structures without aligning the oral, pharyngeal and
              laryngeal axes in patients with cervical spine abnormality. Video
              laryngoscopes such as V-Mac and C-Mac, Glide scope, McGrath,
              Airway Scope, Airtraq, Bonfils and Bullard laryngoscope are
              widely available at the market. Airway gadgets are lighted
              stylets and endotracheal tube guides. The principal conclusion of
              this review is that utilization of these devices can be easily
              learned. The technique of indirect laryngoscopy is currently used
              for managing difficult airway in the operating room as well as
              for securing the airway in daily anesthesia routine.",

              challenging procedure and is frequently associated with life
              threatening complications. The incidence of difficult intubations
              ranges from 10\% to 22\%, depending on the setting and the
              patients in need of endotracheal intubation. Multiple attempts
              are often needed to secure the airway. Despite the high risk for
              patients in the ICU setting, the equipment for airway management
              such as capnometry or alternative devices is not always
              available. The novel technique of video laryngoscopy has been
              recently introduced into clinical practice in the operating room.
              First results from larger studies are very promising, suggesting
              these new devices to be helpful for successful intubation with
              fewer attempts in difficult intubation scenarios. At the same
              time, several reports show that successful use of video

              considered the 'gold-standard' when difficult airway management
              is anticipated. Several videolaryngoscopes have been developed to
              facilitate intubation by laryngoscopy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the
              study was to compare the performance of the McGrath series 5
              videolaryngoscope (McGrath videolaryngoscope) and the FFE for
              tracheal intubation in manikins with a simulated difficult
              airway, hypothesizing that the McGrath videolaryngoscope
              intubation would prove faster than FFE intubation. DESIGN: A
              randomised controlled study. SETTING: The Danish Institute for
              medical simulation between December 2009 and June 2010.
              PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-eight anaesthesia residents participating in
              the Danish mandatory 3-day airway management course.
              INTERVENTIONS: All participants received instructions and
              training in the use of the McGrath videolaryngoscope and FFE. The
              participants then performed tracheal intubation on a SimMan
              manikin once with the McGrath videolaryngoscope and once with the
              FFE in three difficult airway scenarios: (1) pharyngeal
              obstruction; (2) pharyngeal obstruction and cervical rigidity;
              (3) tongue oedema. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We measured successful
              intubations, defined as intubation within 120 s, and time to
              tracheal intubation. RESULTS: The trachea was intubated within
              120 s with the McGrath videolaryngoscope in 25 out of 27 (93\%),
              25 out of 28 (89\%) and 18 out of 28 (64\%) occasions compared
              with 11 out of 28 (40\%), 11 out of 28 (40\%) and 16 out of 28
              (57\%) with the FFE in scenarios (1), (2) and (3), respectively.
              Time to tracheal intubation was shorter with the McGrath
              videolaryngoscope in scenarios (1) and (2) than with the FFE
              (Wilcoxon signed rank sum test, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The
              McGrath videolaryngoscope is a valuable device with higher

              airways. In patients, videolaryngoscopy may have a role in

              and mortality when difficulty is anticipated with airway
              management. Many guidelines developed by national societies have
              focused on management of difficulty encountered in the
              unconscious patient; however, little guidance appears in the
              literature on how best to approach the patient with an
              anticipated difficult airway. METHODS: To review this and other
              subjects, the Canadian Airway Focus Group (CAFG) was re-formed.
              With representation from anesthesiology, emergency medicine, and
              critical care, CAFG members were assigned topics for review. As
              literature reviews were completed, results were presented and
              discussed during teleconferences and two face-to-face meetings.
              When appropriate, evidence- or consensus-based recommendations
              were made, and levels of evidence were assigned. PRINCIPAL
              FINDINGS: Previously published predictors of difficult direct
              laryngoscopy are widely known. More recent studies report
              predictors of difficult face mask ventilation, video
              laryngoscopy, use of a supraglottic device, and cricothyrotomy.
              All are important facets of a complete airway evaluation and must
              be considered when difficulty is anticipated with airway
              management. Many studies now document the increasing patient
              morbidity that occurs with multiple attempts at tracheal
              intubation. Therefore, when difficulty is anticipated, tracheal
              intubation after induction of general anesthesia should be
              considered only when success with the chosen device(s) can be
              predicted in a maximum of three attempts. Concomitant predicted
              difficulty using oxygenation by face mask or supraglottic device
              ventilation as a fallback makes an awake approach advisable.
              Contextual issues, such as patient cooperation, availability of
              additional skilled help, and the clinician's experience, must
              also be considered in deciding the appropriate strategy.
              CONCLUSIONS: With an appropriate airway evaluation and
              consideration of relevant contextual issues, a rational decision
              can be made on whether an awake approach to tracheal intubation
              will maximize patient safety or if airway management can safely
              proceed after induction of general anesthesia. With predicted
              difficulty, close attention should be paid to details of
              implementing the chosen approach. This should include having a

              to consist of three parts: oxygenation (A), tracheal intubation

              a first line strategy for potential and/or encountered difficult

  abstract = "Difficult or unsuccesful tracheal intubation is one of the
              important causes for morbidity and mortality in susceptible
              patients. Almost 30\% of the anesthesia-related deaths are
              induced by the complications of difficult airway management and
              more than 85\% of all respiratory related complications cause
              brain injury or death. Nowadays, due to the advances in
              technology, new videolaryngoscopic devices became available.
              Airtraq is a novel single-use laryngoscope which provides glottis
              display without any deviation in the normal position of the oral,
              pharyngeal or the tracheal axes. With the help of the display
              lens glottis and the surrounding structures are visualised and
              under direct view of its tip the tracheal tube is introduced
              between the vocal cords. In patients having restricted neck
              motion or limited mouth opening (provided that it is greater than
              3 cm) Airtraq offers the advantage of a better display. Moreover
              the video image can be transfered to an external monitor thus an
              experienced specialist can provide assistance and an educational
              course can be conducted simultaneously. On the other hand the
              Airtraq videolaryngoscopic devices possess certain disadvantages
              including the need of experience and the time demand for the
              operator to learn how to use them properly, the rapid
              deterioration of their display in the presence of a swelling or a
              secretion and the fact that they are rather complicated and
              expensive devices. The Airtraq device has already documented
              benefits in the management of difficult airways, however serial

              associated with significant morbidity and mortality in critically
              ill patients. An increasing array of advanced airway tools are
              available, but appropriate selection and application in the ICU
              remains poorly defined. RECENT FINDINGS: Difficult airway
              incidence during emergent intubation is 10\%, but complications
              of ICU airway management remain common. Training and equipment in
              many ICUs remain variable despite data that demonstrate that an
              'intubation management bundle' and a systematic approach to
              teamwork and training can reduce life-threatening airway
              complications. A protocol employing an extraglottic airway (EGA)
              early in cases of inadequate ventilation has been associated with
              no episodes of prolonged hypoxemia in 12 225 consecutive
              intubations. Direct laryngoscopy with gum elastic bougie is the
              most commonly employed method to manage emergent difficult
              airways, and videolaryngoscopes also provide greater glottic
              visualization and a high rate of intubation success in patients
              with difficult airway risk factors or a failed airway. SUMMARY: A
              systematic approach to intubation that emphasizes planning and
              teamwork can reduce intubation complications. Early use of an EGA
              or cricothyroidotomy may reduce complications when oxygenation is
              inadequate. Use of a gum elastic bougie or indirect optical
              device is also associated with a high rate of intubation success
              when oxygenation permits.",

  abstract = "Airway management complications causing temporary patient harm
              are common, but serious injury is rare. Because most airways are
              easy, most complications occur in easy airways: these
              complications can and do lead to harm and death. Because these
              events are rare, most of our learning comes from large litigation
              and critical incident databases that help identify patterns and
              areas where care can be improved: but both have limitations. The
              recent 4th National Audit Project of the Royal College of
              Anaesthetists and Difficult Airway Society provides important
              detailed information and our best estimates of the incidence of
              major airway complications. A significant proportion of airway
              complications occur in Intensive Care Units and Emergency
              Departments, and these more frequently cause patient harm/death
              and are associated with suboptimal care. Hypoxia is the commonest
              cause of airway-related deaths. Obesity markedly increases risk
              of airway complications. Pulmonary aspiration remains the leading
              cause of airway-related anaesthetic deaths, most cases having
              identifiable risk factors. Unrecognized oesophageal intubation is
              not of only historical interest and is entirely avoidable. All
              airway management techniques fail and prediction scores are
              rather poor, so many failures are unanticipated. Avoidance of
              airway complications requires institutional and individual
              preparedness, careful assessment, good planning and judgement,
              good communication and teamwork, knowledge and use of a range of
              techniques and devices, and a willingness to stop performing
              techniques when they are failing. Analysis of major airway
              complications identifies areas where practice is suboptimal;
              research to improve understanding, prevention, and management of
              such complications remains an anaesthetic priority.",

              hospital. Measurements The one-year intubation records of
              intubations performed with reusable intubation scopes, the
              one-year maintenance costs of these scopes, and their three-year
              repair cost records were analyzed. A total of 166 intubations
              were performed with reusable fiberoptic scopes in 2009.
              Calculations to assess the costs per intubation based on the
              documented records at our institution were made. The total cost
              of an intubation, the repair-to-intubation ratio, and the repair
              cost per intubation were determined. Main Results The total cost
              of an intubation at our institution in 2009, using reusable
              scopes, was \$119.75 [US dollars (USD)], which included \$20.15
              (purchasing), \$53.48 (repair), \$33.16 (maintenance), and
              \$12.96 (labor). The repair-to-intubation ratio was 1:55. Repair
              costs were \$53.48 per intubation and \$2,959.44 per instance of
              repair. Conclusions The Ambu aScope, a single-use intubation

  abstract = "Background Intubation using a flexible optical scope (FOS) is a
              cornerstone technique for managing the predicted and unpredicted
              difficult airway. The term FOS covers both fibre-optic scopes and
              videoscopes. The total costs of using flexible scopes for
              intubation are unknown. The recent introduction of a disposable
              flexible scope for intubation merits closer scrutiny of the total
              costs associated with both modalities. Methods The costs incurred
              during intubations using FOSs at a large anaesthesia department
              were identified, and a series of intubations using a disposable
              scope were analyzed for comparison. Recognized health-economic
              methodology was applied. Results During a 1-year period, 360 FOS
              intubations were performed. In this clinical setting, the average
              cost of an intubation using a reusable FOS was €177.7. When using
              the disposable Ambu\textregistered{} aScope (Ambu A/S, Ballerup,
              Denmark), the cost was €204.4. The break-even point, i.e. the
              number of intubations per month where the cost of using
              disposable and non-disposable equipment is identical, was
              22.5/month. A subgroup analysis looking solely at intubations
              performed with flexible videoscopes revealed that the cost per
              intubation was equal for disposable and reusable videoscopes.
              Conclusion At our institution, the total cost of an intubation is
              greater when using disposable compared with reusable equipment
              (€204.4 vs. €177.7). If video equipment with an external monitor
              is considered mandatory, the expenses are of equal magnitude. The
              cost analysis is particularly sensitive to the actual number of
              flexible optic intubations performed; with fewer intubations, the
              total cost will begin to favour disposable equipment.",

  abstract = "Background and methods Tracheostomy is a common procedure in
              intensive care patient management. The aim of this study was to
              capture the practice of tracheostomy in Intensive Care Units in
              the United Kingdom. A postal survey was sent to the lead
              clinicians of 228 general intensive care units (ICUs) throughout
              the United Kingdom excluding specialist units. We aimed to
              identify the current practice of tracheostomy, including timing
              of insertion, equipment used and post-operative care and
              follow-up. Results A response rate of 86.84\% was achieved.
              Percutaneous tracheostomy continues to be favoured over surgical
              tracheostomy with less than 8\% of ICUs opting for surgical
              tracheostomies > 50\% of the time. 89\% of units required only 2
              operators to perform the technique and single stage dilatation is
              the technique of choice in 83\% of units. The Ciaglia technique,
              which was strongly favoured less than a decade ago, is currently
              practiced in less than 5\% of ICUs. Bronchoscopic guidance is an
              important adjunct to the technique of percutaneous tracheostomy
              with 80\% of units using it routinely. Follow-up care of patients
              remains poor with 59\% of ICUs not having routine follow-up once
              the patient has left the unit. Conclusion The practice of
              percutaneous tracheostomy remains the preferred technique within
              the UK. There seems to be a growing preference for single stage
              dilatational techniques. Timing of tracheostomy remains variable
              despite evidence to suggest benefit from an earlier procedure.
              Follow-up of tracheostomised patients after discharge from ICU is
              still low, which may mean significant morbidity from the

              surgical patients, to establish complication rates, and to
              identify areas of this clinical practice that could be improved.
              DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: A
              cardiothoracic intensive care unit in a teaching hospital.
              PARTICIPANTS: The most recent series of 100 tracheostomies
              performed in patients admitted to the intensive care unit.
              INTERVENTIONS: Percutaneous or surgical tracheostomy for
              respiratory management. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of
              95 patients had 1 tracheostomy performed. One patient had a
              tracheostomy performed twice, and 1 patient had a tracheostomy
              performed 3 times; these repetitions were caused by recurrent
              respiratory failure. The median time from tracheal intubation to
              tracheostomy was 5 days (range, 1-23 days; interquartile range,
              4-8 days), and median period between insertion and decannulation
              was 20 days (range, 2-77 days; interquartile range, 12-25 days).
              The most common reason for insertion was an anticipated long
              weaning time (55\%) followed by insertion after failed extubation
              (32\%). The Ciaglia percutaneous dilational technique was used
              for 89\% of tracheostomies, whereas surgical techniques were used
              for 8\%. The most common complication was either complete or
              partial obstruction of the tracheostomy tube (24\%) followed by
              infection of the tracheostomy site in 18\% (17/94) and bleeding
              at the time of insertion (11\%). CONCLUSION: The percutaneous
              dilational technique of tracheostomy was used predominantly in
              this unit. The median time from tracheal intubation to
              tracheostomy was 5 days. The most common complications were
              bleeding at the time of insertion, obstruction of the
              tracheostomy tube, and stomal infection.",

              Intervention None Measurements and results Of the 708 ICUs
              invited to participate, 152 (21.5\%) answered the questionnaire.
              Overall, 35,322 patients (median, 212 patients per unit;
              interquartile range [IQR], 148 to 329 patients) had received MV,
              including one fourth of patients for > 7 days. A median of 7.2\%
              of patients (IQR, 2.9 to 11.1\%) had undergone a tracheostomy.
              The most frequently reported indications for tracheostomy were
              prolonged MV (95\%, after a median of 20 days) and failure of
              extubation (48\%). An indication for ``early'' tracheostomy (ie,
              < 3 weeks) was considered in 68\% of the ICUs, after a median
              time of 7 days. Physicians thought that performing tracheostomy
              would facilitate weaning from MV and early oral nutrition, and
              would improve overall patient comfort. The main disadvantages
              listed were tracheal complications, the aggressiveness of the
              procedure, and the risk of infection. Surgical techniques largely
              remained preferred compared to percutaneous techniques

              of tracheostomy in French ICUs. Three fourths of physicians
              considered that a randomized study comparing prolonged
              translaryngeal intubation and early tracheostomy in patients
              expected to receive prolonged MV would be necessary to clarify

              PARTICIPANTS: An invitation to participate was e-mailed to all

              INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 132
              responses were received; 2 were excluded because they did not
              originate from the United Kingdom. Values are number (percent).
              ANESTHETIC TECHNIQUE: The majority of respondents (109, 85\%)
              maintain anesthesia with a volatile anesthetic agent, with a
              lesser proportion (20, 15\%) reporting use of a total intravenous
              anesthetic technique. The majority of respondents (78, 61\%)
              favor pressure control ventilation over volume control (50,
              39\%); just under half (57, 45\%) report the routine use of
              positive end-expiratory pressure (median = 5 cmH(2)O
              [interquartile range (IQR), 4-5]). Fifty-two (40\%) respondents
              report ventilating to a target tidal volume (median = 6 mL/kg
              [IQR, 5-7]). Most (114, 89\%) respondents routinely ventilate
              with an F(I)O(2) less than 1.0. Thoracic epidural blockade (TEB)
              is favored by nearly two thirds of respondents (80, 62\%)
              compared with paravertebral block (39, 30\%) and other analgesic
              techniques (10, 8\%). Anesthesiologists favoring TEB are
              significantly less likely to prescribe systemic opioids (17, 21\%
              v 39, 100\% [p < 0.001]). Proponents of TEB are significantly
              more likely to ``routinely'' use vasopressor infusions both
              intra- and postoperatively (16, 20\% v 0, 0\% [p = 0.003] and 28,

  abstract = "Tracheal intubation (TI) is a routine procedure in the intensive
              care unit (ICU), and is often life saving. However,
              life-threatening complications occur in a significant proportion
              of procedures, making TI perhaps one the most common but
              underappreciated airway emergencies in the ICU. In contrast to
              the controlled conditions in the operating room (OR), the
              unstable physiologic state of critically ill patients along with
              underevaluation of the airways and suboptimal response to
              pre-oxygenation are the major factors for the high incidence of
              life-threatening complications like severe hypoxaemia and
              cardiovascular collapse in the ICU. Studies have shown that
              strategies planned for TI in the OR can be adapted and
              extrapolated for use in the ICU. Non-invasive positive-pressure
              ventilation for pre-oxygenation provides adequate oxygen stores
              during TI for patients with precarious respiratory pathology. The

  abstract = "Background Little is known about trends in the utilization or
              complication rates of transbronchial lung biopsy, particularly in
              community hospitals. Methods We used the Healthcare Cost and
              Utilization Project Florida State Inpatient and State Ambulatory
              Surgical Databases to assess trends in transbronchial lung biopsy
              utilization in adults from 2000 to 2009. We subsequently
              calculated population based estimates of complications associated
              with transbronchial lung biopsy (iatrogenic pneumothorax and
              procedure-related hemorrhage) and identified characteristics
              associated with complications. Results From 2000 to 2009, the
              age-adjusted rate of transbronchial biopsies per 100,000 adults
              in Florida decreased by 25\% from 74 to 55 (p<0.0001), despite
              stability in the overall utilization of bronchoscopy. Analysis of
              82,059 procedures revealed that complications associated with
              transbronchial biopsy were uncommon and stable over the study
              period, with 0.97\% (95\% CI 0.94--1.01\%) of procedures
              complicated by pneumothorax, 0.55\% (95\% CI 0.52--0.58\%) by
              pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement, and 0.58\% (95\% CI
              0.55--0.61\%) by procedure-related hemorrhage. Patients with COPD
              (OR 1.51, 95\% CI 1.31--1.75) and women (OR 1.32, 95\% CI
              1.15--1.52) were at increased risk for pneumothorax, while renal
              failure (OR 2.85, 95\% CI 2.10-- 3.87), cirrhosis (OR 2.31, 95\%
              CI 1.18-- 4.52), older age (OR 1.17, 95\% CI 1.09--1.25) and
              female sex (OR 1.40, 95\% CI 1.17--1.68) were associated with
              higher risk of procedure-related hemorrhage. Conclusions
              Utilization of transbronchial lung biopsy is decreasing relative
              to the overall use of bronchoscopy. Nevertheless, it remains a
              safe procedure with low risk of complications.",

               advances in the understanding of various diseases and new
               insights that have led to more effective and targeted therapies.
               In spite of this program, the difficulty obtaining jobs after
               the postdoc period has discouraged many domestic students from
               pursuing graduate postdoc training. In the United States, more
               than 50 percent of the postdoc workforce is made up of
               individuals who obtained their Ph. D.s from other countries.
               Indeed, one can make a strong argument that the influx of highly
               trained and creative foreigners has contributed greatly to U.S.
               science over the past 70 years. Research Training in the
               Biomedical, Behavioral, and Clinical Research Sciences discusses
               a number of important issues, including: the job prospects for

              Minimally invasive techniques provide unquestionable benefits to

              techniques are not intuitive, and extensive training is required

              to use a factorial design. If the application is suitable,

              This paper presents a flexible method for amalgamating these two
              devices. Designs are constructed from smaller designs, known as
              bricks, generated cyclically from tabulated initial sequences.
              The bricks have known efficiencies for estimation of direct
              treatment main effects and interactions; the efficiencies can be
              simply combined to approximate the efficiencies of the whole
              design. This allows the user to build a design that is tailored
              to the particular objectives of the experiment. Three and four

  abstract = "PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of shockwave
              lithotripsy (SWL) versus ureteroscopic lithotripsy (URS) for
              patients with ureteral stones less than 1.5 cm in diameter.
              METHODS: Patient age, stone diameter, stone location, and
              stone-free status were recorded for patients treated with SWL or
              URS for ureteral stones under 1.5 cm over a 1 year period.
              Institutional charges were obtained from in-house billing. A
              decision analysis model was constructed to compare the
              cost-effectiveness of SWL and URS using our results and success
              rates for modeling. Three separate models were created to reflect
              differing practice patterns. RESULTS: A total of 113 patients
              were included-51 underwent SWL and 62 underwent URS as primary
              treatment. Single procedure stone-free rates for SWL and URS were
              47.1 and 88.7 \%, respectively (p < 0.002). Decision analysis
              modeling demonstrated cost-effectiveness of SWL when SWL single
              procedure stone-free rates (SFR) were greater than or equal to
              60-64 \% or when URS single procedure SFRs were less than or
              equal to 57-76 \%, depending on practice patterns. CONCLUSIONS:
              This retrospective study revealed superior SFR for ureteral
              stones less than 1.5 cm treated with URS compared to SWL. Our
              decision analysis model demonstrated that when SFR for SWL is
              less than 60-64 \% or is greater than 57-76 \% for URS, SWL is
              not a cost-effective treatment option. Based on these findings,
              careful stratification and selection of stone patients may enable
              surgeons to increase the cost-effectiveness of SWL.",

  abstract = "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Ureteral access sheath (UAS) became
              increasingly popular worldwide. However, the safety of its
              routine use remains controversial. The aim of the current
              revision is to provide a systematic review on the benefits and
              disadvantages of the UAS. RECENT FINDINGS: A systematic review
              was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for
              Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses criteria. Two reviewers
              independently searched the literature, finally identifying 20
              articles valuable for this review. The use of UAS demonstrated
              several advantages to facilitate retrograde intrarenal access,
              lower intrarenal pressure, protect the ureter, protect the scope,
              and expedite stone extraction. Despite this, there is also some
              evidence that UAS use may be associated with acute ureteral
              injury and long-term complications, apparently related to
              maneuvers for UAS insertion and mucosal or deeper layers of
              injury and ischemia. Furthermore, there are still pending
              questions on the possible increase in stone-free rates, and
              decrease in operative time and costs. SUMMARY: Although the use
              of UAS is associated with some risk and limiting factors, it
              appears from this systematic review that its use is common and
              safe for the retrograde intrarenal access. Therefore, UAS is
              highly recommended for the treatment of upper tract disease by
              means of retrograde intrarenal surgery.",

              health; even an unruptured intracranial aneurysm is an anxious
              condition for the individual. The aim of this guideline is to
              present current and comprehensive recommendations for the
              management of intracranial aneurysms, with or without rupture.
              MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed an extensive literature
              search, using Medline. We met in person to discuss
              recommendations. This document is reviewed by the Task Force Team
              of the Korean Society of Interventional Neuroradiology (KSIN).
              RESULTS: We divided the current guideline for ruptured
              intracranial aneurysms (RIAs) and unruptured intracranial
              aneurysms (UIAs). The guideline for RIAs focuses on diagnosis and

              shown to be a safe and feasible method for the treatment of
              coronary artery disease in highly selected patients. However,
              long-term outcome data comparing robotic CABG with conventional
              CABG are still missing. Therefore, we aimed to compare robotic
              with conventional CABG in terms of perioperative and long-term
              outcomes. METHODS: Of 2947 consecutive elective patients with
              coronary artery disease operated at a single center between 2001
              and 2013, 280 underwent robotic CABG. After propensity score
              matching, 134 pairs of robotic versus conventional CABG (age = 62
              $\pm$ 10 years, log EuroScore = 2.4 $\pm$ 2.4\% vs. mean $\pm$ SD
              age = 63 $\pm$ 10 years, log EuroScore 2.5 $\pm$ 1.7\%,
              respectively; all P > 0.05) were formed. The mean $\pm$ SD
              follow-up was 6.6 $\pm$ 3.2 years. RESULTS: There was no
              difference in perioperative mortality (robotic = 0\% vs.
              conventional = 1.5\%, P = 0.154), myocardial infarction (robotic
              = 0\% vs. conventional = 2.2\%, P = 0.08), and stroke rate
              (robotic = 0\% vs. conventional = 0.7\%, P = 0.318) between the
              groups. Longer cardiopulmonary bypass (robotic = 112 $\pm$ 100
              minutes vs. conventional = 67 $\pm$ 48 minutes, P < 0.0001) and
              cross-clamp times (robotic = 68 $\pm$ 54 minutes vs. conventional
              = 38 $\pm$ 27 minutes, P < 0.0001) were observed in robotic
              patients. Long-term follow-up yielded equivalent results in terms
              of survival (1, 5, and 10 years: robotic = 99.3\%, 96.9\%, and
              81.3\% vs. conventional = 96.3\%, 92.2\%, and 82.6\%,
              respectively; log-rank P = 0.187) and freedom from major adverse
              cardiac and cerebral events at 1, 5, and 10 years after procedure
              (robotic = 90.6\%, 77.7\%, 70.1\% vs. conventional = 94.1\%,
              82.2\%, 66.6\%; log-rank P = 0.790). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term
              outcomes of robotic CABG are comparable with conventional CABG
              for selected patients. Longer operative times of robotic CABG do
              not influence the excellent long-term outcomes.",

  abstract = "The optimal timing of valve surgery remains controversial.
              Biomarkers can be serially monitored and are objective laboratory
              measurements. Plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and its
              N-terminal pro-form are well known predictors in heart failure.
              Diastolic stretch induces cardiomyocyte BNP expression in
              volume-loaded conditions like aortic or mitral regurgitation (MR)
              or pressure-loaded conditions like aortic stenosis (AS). Here, we
              review the value of natriuretic peptide measurements in valve
              disease. Cardiac decompensation is reflected by increased BNP in
              AS and in MR. Repeated marked increases in natriuretic peptides
              are a potential indication for valve replacement in severe
              asymptomatic AS with normal ejection fraction and exercise test
              results. High BNP level also predicts postoperative outcome.
              Increased BNP level is associated with low-flow AS, impaired left
              ventricular longitudinal strain, and myocardial fibrosis. The BNP
              ratio to the reference value for age and sex incrementally
              predicts mortality in AS. Increased BNP reflects the hemodynamic
              consequences of MR and is associated with exercise-induced
              pulmonary-arterial hypertension and reduced contractile reserve.
              In severe primary MR, increased and serially increasing BNP or
              N-terminal pro-form BNP might be helpful in guiding early mitral
              replacement. In conclusion, baseline (N-terminal pro-form) BNP
              should be obtained in all severe valve disease patients and
              interpreted together with clinical and echocardiography findings.
              Very high BNP values are associated with increased mortality and
              should lead to close monitoring peri- and postoperatively.
              Progressively increasing BNP in asymptomatic patients points to
              advancing valve disease. BNP adds important incremental
              prognostic information that is useful for valve patient
              management and for optimal timing of surgery in particular.",

  abstract = "Background The era of patient-centered care might lead to the
              conclusion that there are as many configurations of healthcare
              utilization within episodes of care as there are patients.
              However, variability among episodes of care is limited by factors
              such as local resources or patient characteristics. As a result,
              the differences among episodes of care are reduced, and a limited
              number of care trajectories are expected. Objective The aim of
              this study was to investigate the ability to identify clinically
              significant care trajectories using data on healthcare services
              used by patients with endometrial cancer. Methods A retrospective
              review of sixteen healthcare services used by 394 patients newly
              diagnosed with endometrial cancer was undertaken. Latent class
              analysis was used to investigate care trajectories. Results The
              analyses segregated patients into six care trajectories: 1)
              surgery without hospitalizations and emergency room [ER] visits;
              2) surgery with hospitalizations and ER visits; 3) surgery,
              radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, without hospitalizations and
              ER visits; 4) surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, with
              hospitalizations and ER visits; 5) surgery and radiation therapy;
              6) surgery and chemotherapy, with hospitalizations and ER visits.
              Classification of patients in trajectories with versus without
              hospitalizations and ER visits could only partially be explained
              by age, cancer stage, and grade. Concluding statement Utilization
              of healthcare services can be grouped into a number of defined
              trajectories in endometrial cancer. Identifying care trajectories
              and parameters associated with care trajectories could have

              The aim of this study is to compare the performance of nodule
              malignancy risk prediction tools using diameter or volume and
              between computer-aided detection (CAD) and radiologist
              measurements. METHODS: Multivariable logistic regression models
              were prepared using data from two multi-center lung cancer
              screening trials. For model development and validation, baseline
              LDCT scans from the PanCan Study and a subset of National Lung
              Screening Trial (NLST) scans with lung nodule $\geq$3 mm in mean
              diameter were analysed using the CIRRUS Lung Screening
              Workstation (Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, the
              Netherlands). In the NLST sample, nodules with cancer had been
              matched on size to nodules without cancer. RESULTS: Both
              CAD-based mean diameter and volume models showed excellent
              discrimination and calibration, with similar areas under the
              receiver-operating-characteristic curves of 0.947. The two CAD
              models had similar predictive performance to the
              radiologist-based model. In NLST validation data, the CAD Mean
              Diameter and Volume models also demonstrated excellent
              discrimination: AUC's 0.810 and 0.821, respectively. These
              performance statistics are similar to the PanCan Malignancy
              Probability Model in these data using radiologist measured
              maximum diameter. CONCLUSION: Either CAD-based nodule diameter or

              devised to reduce costly screw-related complications, yet their
              clinical effectiveness has never been comparatively assessed in a
              meta-analysis. We aimed to evaluate the incidence of clinically
              relevant pedicle screw revisions among robot-guided, navigated,
              and freehand spinal instrumentation. METHODS: Controlled trials
              comparing robot-guided, navigated, or freehand spinal
              instrumentation for any indication and that specifically reported
              the proportion of patients who experienced pedicle screw
              revisions were included. Estimates were pooled using
              random-effects meta-analyses. Sensitivity analyses including
              zero-event trials and assessing per screw incidences were carried
              out. RESULTS: Among 37 studies (7095 patients), intraoperative
              revisions in robot-guided (odds ratio [OR], 3.6; 95\% confidence
              interval [CI], 0.7-19.4; P = 0.14) and navigated (OR, 1.5; 95\%
              CI, 0.3-7.2; P = 0.64) procedures were comparable to freehand.
              Although postoperative revisions were reduced in robot-guided
              (OR, 0.3; 95\% CI, 0.1-0.9; P = 0.04) and navigated (OR, 0.3;
              95\% CI, 0.2-0.5; P < 0.001) procedures, statistical significance
              was lost in sensitivity analyses for robotic guidance, but not
              for navigation. The pooled incidence of malpositioned screws
              requiring postoperative revision was 2.1\%. CONCLUSIONS: Based on
              the available data in the peer-reviewed literature, computer
              assistance in the form of robotic guidance or navigation has the
              potential to reduce the incidence of costly and clinically
              relevant postoperative revisions for screw malposition. It is
              essential to further investigate on a higher level of evidence if

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Laryngoceles are air-filled sacs which communicate
              with the laryngeal lumen. When filled with mucus or pus, they are
              called laryngomucoceles and laryngopyoceles, respectively.
              Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) is a new and remarkable
              technique that expands its usefullness in otorhinolaryngology.
              Conventional treatments for laryngoceles were previously
              performed using external approaches, with aesthetically
              unfavorable and less function-sparing results. Transoral laser
              microsurgical approaches for laryngoceles were seldom reported.
              It is aimed to present authors' clinical experience on
              laryngocele management with TORS which is a rather new technique.
              STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective patient serial. METHODS: Patients
              were evaluated for demographic data, type of lesion, reasons for
              hospital admittance, complaint duration, and previous surgery.
              Robotic surgery panel including anesthesia time, duration of
              surgery, need for tracheotomy, postoperative care, follow-up, and
              recurrence rates were also summarized. RESULTS: Six men (mean age
              51.7 years; range 41-62) with laryngoceles underwent successful
              TORS. Dyspnea and hoarseness were the main complaints. Two
              patients had undergone previous laryngeal surgery due to
              laryngeal cancer, with no recurrence of malignancy at admittance
              for laryngocele. Three had simple laryngocele, 2 had
              laryngomucocele, and 1 had laryngopyocele. No laryngoceles
              recurred and no complication such as dysphonia or prolonged
              dysphagia occurred. CONCLUSION: Transoral robotic surgery was
              found superior in safety, technical feasibility and curative
              effectiveness, when compared with classical methods, especially
              due to absence of skin incisions. Surgical modalities for
              laryngocele excision should be directed toward a curative target
              including cosmetic and functional success, technical
              achievability, and surgically curative methods. Transoral robotic
              surgery provided all these features.",

              acceptance-of spinal neurosurgeons. But successful innovation,
              scientific or commercial, requires the majority to adopt a new
              practice. ``Faster, better, cheaper'' products should in theory
              conquer the market, but often fail. The psychology of change is
              complex, and the ``follow the leader'' mentality, common in the
              field today, lends little trust to the process of disseminating
              new technology. Beyond product quality, timing has proven to be a
              key factor in the inception, design, and execution of new
              technologies. Although the first robotic surgery was performed in
              1985, scant progress was seen until the era of minimally invasive
              surgery. This movement increased neurosurgeons' dependence on
              navigation and fluoroscopy, intensifying the drive for enhanced
              precision. Outside the field of medicine, various technology
              companies have made great progress in popularizing co-robots
              (``cobots''), augmented reality, and processor chips. This has
              helped to ease practicing surgeons into familiarity with and
              acceptance of these technologies. The adoption among
              neurosurgeons in training is a ``follow the leader'' phenomenon,
              wherein new surgeons tend to adopt the technology used during
              residency. In neurosurgery today, robots are limited to computers
              functioning between the surgeon and patient. Their functions are
              confined to establishing a trajectory for navigation, with task
              execution solely in the surgeon's hands. In this review, the

              used for more meaningful applications. They explore the history

               not always reliable. Various minimally invasive surgery
               instruments that provide tactile feedback have been proposed to
               augment ultrasound sensing for tumor localization; however,

               hand-held palpation instrument that uses a custom, low-cost,
               disposable tactile sensor to provide tactile and kinesthetic
               force feedback. The use of a replaceable, disposable tactile
               sensor avoids deterioration in sensor performance due to
               repeated autoclaving. The instrument features a passive joint in
               the end effector that allows the sensor to self-align to the
               palpation surface in a wide range of orientations. All of the
               electronics are packaged in a removable module that allows the
               rest of the instrument to be easily cleaned and autoclaved. Two

              individuals with solid pulmonary nodules and to generate new
              recommendations for those with nonsolid nodules. METHODS: We
              updated prior literature reviews, synthesized evidence, and
              formulated recommendations by using the methods described in the
              ``Methodology for Development of Guidelines for Lung Cancer'' in
              the American College of Chest Physicians Lung Cancer Guidelines,
              3rd ed. RESULTS: We formulated recommendations for evaluating
              solid pulmonary nodules that measure > 8 mm in diameter, solid
              nodules that measure $\leq$ 8 mm in diameter, and subsolid
              nodules. The recommendations stress the value of assessing the
              probability of malignancy, the utility of imaging tests, the need
              to weigh the benefits and harms of different management
              strategies (nonsurgical biopsy, surgical resection, and

              eliciting patient preferences. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with

              the probability of malignancy, performing imaging tests to better
              characterize the lesions, evaluating the risks associated with

              orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) access is of
              paramount importance. The over-the-scope clip (OTSC) system has
              previously been shown to be effective for NOTES gastrotomy
              closure. OBJECTIVE: To compare OTSC gastrotomy closure with
              surgical closure. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled animal study.
              SETTING: Animal facility laboratory. ANIMALS: Thirty-six female
              domestic pigs. INTERVENTIONS: Gastrotomies were created by using
              a needle-knife and an 18-mm balloon. The animals were
              subsequently randomized to either open surgical repair with
              interrupted sutures or endoscopic repair with 12-mm OTSCs. In
              addition, pressurized leak tests were performed in ex vivo
              specimens of 18-mm scalpel incisions closed with suture (n = 14)
              and of intact stomachs (n = 10). MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The
              mean time for endoscopic closure was 9.8 minutes (range 3-22, SD
              5.5). No complications occurred during either type of gastrotomy
              closure. At necropsy, examination of all OTSC and surgical
              closures demonstrated complete sealing of gastrotomy sites
              without evidence of injury to adjacent organs. Pressurized leak
              tests showed a mean burst pressure of 83 mm Hg (range 30-140, SD
              27) for OTSC closures and 67 mm Hg (range 30-130, SD 27.7) for
              surgical sutures. Ex vivo hand-sewn sutures of 18-mm gastrotomies
              (n = 14) exhibited a mean burst pressure of 65 mm Hg (range
              20-140, SD 31) and intact ex vivo stomachs (n = 10) had a mean
              burst pressure of 126 mm Hg (range 90-170, SD 28). The burst
              pressure of ex vivo intact stomachs was significantly higher
              compared with OTSC closures (P < .01), in vivo surgical closures
              (P < .01), and ex vivo hand-sewn closures (P < .01). There was a
              trend toward higher burst pressures in the OTSC closures compared
              with surgical closures (P = .063) and ex vivo hand-sewn closures
              (P = .094). In vivo surgical closures demonstrated similar burst
              pressures compared with ex vivo hand-sewn closures (P = .848).
              LIMITATIONS: Nonsurvival setting. CONCLUSION: Endoscopic closure
              by using the OTSC system is comparable to surgical closure in a
              nonsurvival porcine model. This technique is easy to perform and
              is suitable for NOTES gastrotomy closure.",

              complementary metal oxide silicone technologies for imaging, lens
              improvements and the requirements for different frame rates and

              received active treatment in the RISA Trial) participated in the
              long-term follow-up study for 5 years. The rate of respiratory
              adverse events (AEs per patient per year) was 1.4, 2.4, 1.7, and
              2.4, respectively, in years 2 to 5 after BT. There was a decrease
              in hospitalizations and emergency department visits for
              respiratory symptoms in each of years 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 compared

              as well as specially trained, highly skilled personnel to perform
              the surgery continues to restrict the utility of NOTES. Thus,

              endoscopic myotomy (POEM) has been shown to be effective in
              several short-term studies. Longer term outcome data are largely
              non-existent. OBJECTIVE: To systematically report clinical
              outcome with a minimum post-POEM follow-up of 2 years. DESIGN:
              All patients treated consecutively by POEM for achalasia at three
              centres were retrospectively analysed, with a minimum follow-up
              of 2 years. The main outcome was the rate of POEM failures
              (Eckardt score >3) related to follow-up time. RESULTS: Of 85
              patients treated, five (5.9\%) cases were excluded due to
              protocol violation or loss to follow-up; the remaining 80
              patients (mean age 44.9 years, 54\% men) were followed clinically
              for 29 months (range 24-41). Initial clinical response was
              observed in 77 cases (96.3\%). Clinical recurrences (later
              failures) were seen in a further 14 cases (17.7\%), accounting
              for a total failure rate of 21.5\%. In a multivariate analysis,
              age and endoscopic reflux signs were independent predictors of
              treatment success. Of the 17 failures, eight were among the first
              10 cases treated in the participating centres. Reflux-associated
              sequelae included one case of a severe reflux-associated
              stricture requiring dilatation, and two patients with minor
              transient Eckardt score elevations curable by proton pump
              inhibitor (PPI) treatment. Endoscopic signs of reflux
              oesophagitis, mostly Los Angeles grade A/B, were seen in 37.5\%
              (37/72) at the 2-year control. CONCLUSIONS: In this multicentre
              retrospective analysis, a high initial success rate of POEM is
              followed by a mid-term recurrence rate of 18\%. Reflux
              oesophagitis, albeit mild, is frequent and should probably be
              treated by regular low-dose PPI therapy. TRIAL REGISTRATION

              lung nodule, peripheral lung lesion, and bronchoscopic treatment.
              We focused on peripheral pulmonary nodules that are confirmed or
              highly likely to be malignant. Seventy-one articles were included

              radiographic features of DPLD who underwent TBC at Mayo Clinic in
              Rochester, Minnesota from June 2013 to September 2015. RESULTS:
              Seventy-four patients (33 women [45\%]) with a mean age of 63
              years (SD, 13.8) were included. The mean maximal diameter of the

              of samples per procedure was three (range, one to seven).
              Diagnostic yield was 51\% (38 of 74 specimens). The most frequent
              histopathologic patterns were granulomatous inflammation (12
              patients) and organizing pneumonia (OP) (11 patients), resulting

              undergo transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) in a pulmonary hospital
              in Tehran, Iran. Each patient underwent conventional TBLB and
              flexible cryoprobe TBLB (FCLB) sequentially. Specimen adequacy
              was defined by the presence of at least 50 alveolar spaces or a

              SLB and 297 underwent TBLC. The median time of hospitalization
              was 6.1 days (SLB) and 2.6 days (TBLC; p < 0.0001). Mortality due
              to adverse events was observed for 2.7\% (SLB) and 0.3\% (TBLC)

              diagnostic for 246 patients (82.8\%), SLB for 148 patients
              (98.7\%, p = 0.013). A meta-analysis of 15 investigations
              including 781 patients revealed an overall DY of 0.81
              (0.75-0.87); the overall pooled probability of developing a
              pneumothorax, as retrieved from 15 studies including 994
              patients, was 0.06 (95\% CI 0.02-0.11). CONCLUSION: Cryobiopsy is
              safe and has lower complication and mortality rates compared to
              SLB. TBLC might, therefore, be considered the first diagnostic
              approach for obtaining tissue in ILDs, reserving the surgical
              approach for cases in which TBLC is not diagnostic.",

              the present study was to evaluate the feasibility of a new
              cryoprobe with which biopsy samples can be obtained through the
              working channel of the flexible bronchoscope. METHODS: The
              feasibility of obtaining transbronchial specimens with TBCB was
              tested and the technique was compared to transbronchial forceps
              biopsy (TBFB) in a prospectively randomized ex vivo animal study
              using a standard flexible bronchoscopy technique. The rate of
              successful biopsies and the duration of the sampling procedure
              were recorded for both methods. Size and quality of the biopsies
              were histologically evaluated and measured. RESULTS: Biopsy
              samples could be obtained in 93.3\% of TBCB and in 79.0\% of TBFB
              procedures (p = 0.182). Sampling procedure time did not differ in
              any clinically relevant manner between the two methods. The mean
              specimen area of TBCB samples was significantly higher compared
              to that of TBFB samples (8.08 $\pm$ 5.80 vs. 2.61 $\pm$ 2.14 mm2;
              p < 0.0001). TBCB specimens showed less artifacts and a

              25.42\%; p = 0.0285) than TBFB specimens. CONCLUSIONS: It is
              feasible to retrieve TBCB samples of good quality and size with
              the new mini cryoprobe through the working channel of the
              bronchoscope, while the bronchoscope remains within the central

  abstract = "Screening for lung cancer with low dose computed tomography can
              reduce mortality from the disease by 20\% in high risk smokers.
              This review covers the state of the art knowledge on several
              aspects of implementing a screening program. The most important
              are to identify people who are at high enough risk to warrant
              screening and the appropriate management of lung nodules found at
              screening. An accurate risk prediction model is more efficient
              than age and pack years of smoking alone at identifying those who
              will develop lung cancer and die from the disease. Algorithms are
              available for assessing people who screen positive to determine
              who needs additional imaging or invasive investigations. Concerns
              about low dose computed tomography screening include false
              positive results, overdiagnosis, radiation exposure, and costs.
              Further work is needed to define the frequency and duration of
              screening and to refine risk prediction models so that they can
              be used to assess the risk of lung cancer in special populations.
              Another important area is the use of computer vision software
              tools to facilitate high throughput interpretation of low dose
              computed tomography images so that costs can be reduced and the
              consistency of scan interpretation can be improved. Sufficient
              data are available to support the implementation of screening
              programs at the population level in stages that can be expanded

              clinical and radiological data are inconclusive. However,
              cryobiopsy is acquiring an important role in the ILD diagnostic
              process. The objective of this study was to evaluate the
              diagnostic yield, safety and economic costs of the systematic use
              of cryobiopsy in the assessment of patients with suspected ILD.
              METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study of patients
              who had undergone transbronchial cryobiopsy for evaluation of ILD
              from January 2011 to January 2014. The procedures were performed
              with a video bronchoscope using a cryoprobe for the collection of
              lung parenchyma specimens, which were analyzed by pathologists.
              Diagnostic yield, complications and economic costs of this
              technique were analyzed. RESULTS: Criobiopsy specimens from a
              total of 33 patients were included. A specific diagnosis was
              obtained in 26, producing a diagnostic yield of 79\%. In 5
              patients, SLB was required for a histopathological confirmation
              of disease, but the procedure could not be performed in 4, due to
              severe comorbidities. The most frequent complications were
              pneumothorax (12\%) and gradei (9\%) or gradeii (21\%) bleeding.
              There were no life-threatening complications. The systematic use
              of cryobiopsy saved up to €59,846. CONCLUSION: Cryobiopsy is a

              are rare and often cause significant symptoms particularly when

              shown to be effective in the treatment of primary malignancies of
              the endobronchial tree. This is the first detailed analysis of
              the application of cryotherapy to endobronchial metastatic tumors
              of extrapulmonary origin. This study assessed the role of
              endobronchial cryotherapy in the management of these patients,
              including control of symptoms and improvement in endobronchial
              patency. METHODS: The details of 35 patients treated over a
              17-year period were reviewed. Patients' ages ranged from 22 to 80
              years. The primary tumors were mainly colorectal and renal.
              RESULTS: There were no perioperative or in-patient deaths.
              Endobronchial cryotherapy was carried out as a day-case procedure
              in over 80\% of cases. Of the 35 patients, 30 (85\%) reported a

              (cryo-TBB) is a new method which is currently used by our
              institute as well as others with excellent results. OBJECTIVES:
              To assess the safety of cryo-TBB compared with conventional
              forceps TBB. METHODS: We performed a retrospective data
              evaluation of 300 consecutive patients who underwent cryo-TBB
              between January 2012 and April 2014 and compared them with
              historical cases treated with forceps TBB between 2010 and 2012.
              The results of both diagnostic modalities were compared based on
              pathological reports. The major complications (significant
              bleeding and pneumothorax) were compared, along with
              postprocedural hospitalization. RESULTS: Pneumothorax was
              observed in 15 cases (4.95\%) treated with cryo-TBB versus 9
              cases (3.15\%) treated with forceps TBB, with no significant
              difference (p = 0.303). The insertion of a chest tube was
              necessary in 6 (2\%) and 4 (1.3\%) of the cases having undergone
              cryo-TBB or forceps TBB, respectively (p = 0.8). In the cryo-TBB

              significant difference in hospital admission rates between the
              groups [cryo-TBB: 10 (3.3\%); forceps TBB: 4 (1.44\%); p =
              0.181]. The safety profile of cryo- and forceps TBB remained the

              procedures in a pilot study comparing CPBx to FTBBx in patients
              after lung transplantation. METHODS: Patients who had undergone
              lung transplant and who were scheduled for bronchoscopy were
              sequentially enrolled between November 2011 and September 2012.
              Inclusion criteria included age . 18 years and bilateral,
              orthotopic lung transplant. Exclusion criteria were coagulopathy,
              FEV 1 < 0.8 L, diffuse bullous disease, hemodynamic instability,
              and severe hypoxemia (Pa(O2) < 55 mm Hg or Sp(O2) < 92\% on room
              air). Twenty-one procedures were performed, 10 using rigid
              bronchoscopy followed by 11 via flexible bronchoscopy. Patients
              were monitored for complications including pneumothorax,
              hemodynamic instability, and/or respiratory distress. Bleeding
              was categorized on an adapted grading system. RESULTS: Twenty-one
              procedures in 17 patients (median age: 52 years; 12 male
              patients) were performed. Specimen area and percent open alveoli
              were significantly greater using CPBx compared with FTBBx ( P <
              .05). No clinically significant procedural complications occurred
              and all patients were discharged the day of the procedure.
              CONCLUSIONS: The use of the cryoprobe is a safe, alternative
              technique to FTBBx during post-lung transplant bronchoscopy.
              Further studies are needed to determine if larger samples
              obtained with CPBx translate to an increased diagnostic yield.",

              to determine the histological changes after bronchoscopic,
              endoscopic and open SCT on tissues in the thoracic cavity.
              METHODS: Yorkshire pigs underwent flexible bronchoscopy,
              endoscopy and thoracotomy for SCT of the airway, oesophagus and
              other intrathoracic structures, respectively. Variations in the
              duration and number of spray cycles for the same dosimetry were
              compared. RESULTS: Bronchoscopic SCT of the airway resulted in
              cellular death up to the cartilage layer. Endoscopic SCT of the
              oesophagus led to cell death up to the adventitial layer. Tissue
              necrosis was severe in the lung, of full thickness in the pleura,
              but very superficial in the great vessels. The extracellular
              matrix (ECM) of treated tissues remained well-preserved. Having
              shorter but more cycles of SCT decreased the depth of the
              cellular necrosis. One pig developed ventricular fibrillation
              during the surgery and expired. CONCLUSIONS: SCT causes
              reproducible tissue injury with the preserved ECM of most tissues

              around vital structures like the great vessels with a decreased

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Symptomatic airway obstructions are common with
              endobronchial exophytic tumors and may result in lethal
              complications. Recently, a cryorecanalization procedure has
              emerged that plays a role in the immediate management of airway
              obstruction. This study was conducted to investigate the value of
              cryorecanalization for the immediate management of endobronchial
              obstructive pathology and to determine the factors that affect
              the success of the procedure. METHODS: We analyzed 40 patients
              with symptoms of airway obstruction who were admitted to our
              hospital from 2006 to 2010. Patients with exophytic stenosis due
              to primary bronchial or metastatic neoplasms who underwent
              cryorecanalization procedures were included. Patients were
              excluded if they had involvement of a major artery near the site
              of the intervention. The procedure was not performed on patients
              with coagulation abnormalities or thrombocyte count and
              aggregation problems. The data were collected retrospectively.
              RESULTS: Successful cryorecanalization was achieved in 72.5 \% of
              patients. We found that the success rate was mainly related to
              the presence of the distal involvement and the older age of
              obstruction. Restenosis rate was 17.2 \%. [corrected] The mean
              survival time after the cryorecanalization procedure was 11 $\pm$
              12.7 months. No complications occurred in 14 patients. No severe
              bleeding was observed for any patients, and moderate hemorrhaging
              occurred in ten patients, which was stopped with an argon plasma
              coagulator. We experienced no intraoperative mortality.
              CONCLUSIONS: Cryorecanalization is a successful and safe
              intervention for the immediate management of endobronchial
              stenosis. Appropriate patient selection and high success rates

              last decade, enabling real-time guidance of transbronchial needle
              aspiration (TBNA) of mediastinal and hilar structures and
              parabronchial lung masses. The many publications produced about
              EBUS-TBNA have led to a better understanding of the performance
              characteristics of this procedure. The goal of this document was
              to examine the current literature on the technical aspects of
              EBUS-TBNA as they relate to patient, technology, and
              proceduralist factors to provide evidence-based and expert
              guidance to clinicians. METHODS: Rigorous methodology has been
              applied to provide a trustworthy evidence-based guideline and
              expert panel report. A group of approved panelists developed key
              clinical questions by using the PICO (population, intervention,
              comparator, and outcome) format that addressed specific topics on
              the technical aspects of EBUS-TBNA. MEDLINE (via PubMed) and the
              Cochrane Library were systematically searched for relevant
              literature, which was supplemented by manual searches. References
              were screened for inclusion, and well-recognized document
              evaluation tools were used to assess the quality of included
              studies, to extract meaningful data, and to grade the level of
              evidence to support each recommendation or suggestion. RESULTS:
              Our systematic review and critical analysis of the literature on
              15 PICO questions related to the technical aspects of EBUS-TBNA
              resulted in 12 statements: 7 evidence-based graded
              recommendations and 5 ungraded consensus-based statements. Three
              questions did not have sufficient evidence to generate a
              statement. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence on the technical aspects of
              EBUS-TBNA varies in strength but is satisfactory in certain areas
              to guide clinicians on the best conditions to perform EBUS-guided

  abstract = "Emphysema and asthma are responsible for economic and social
              burden. Altering the natural course of these diseases is a field
              of intense research. The National Emphysema Treatment Trial
              showed that lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) could
              significantly reduce both morbidity and mortality in properly
              selected patients. LVRS is seldom performed, however, due to the
              high morbidity associated with the surgery. Numerous
              bronchoscopic interventions have been introduced with the goal of
              providing the clinical benefits of LVRS without the surgical
              complications. Thus far, these modalities have not produced the
              results once hoped. However, through active modification of both
              technique and patient selection, the role of minimally invasive

              Bronchial thermoplasty (BT) is a method of delivering controlled
              heat to airway mucosa with the goal of reducing airway smooth

              from asthma who cannot achieve control with standard medical
              care, BT has been shown to be safe and improves symptoms, with
              long lasting benefit. BT does not seem to affect traditional
              markers of asthma severity such as forced expiratory volume in 1

              administered to all US and Canadian IP fellowship directors and
              graduates in training from 2006 to 2011. The survey inquired
              about all diagnostic and therapeutic procedures performed during

              sampling done fi rst; (2) evaluation inconsistent with
              guidelines, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) present,
              mediastinal sampling performed but not as part of the fi rst
              invasive test; (3) evaluation inconsistent with guidelines, NSCLC
              present, mediastinal sampling never done; and (4) evaluation
              inconsistent with guidelines, small cell lung cancer. The primary
              outcome was whether guideline-consistent care was delivered.
              Secondary outcomes included whether patients with NSCLC ever had
              mediastinal sampling and use of transbronchial needle aspiration
              (TBNA) among pulmonologists. RESULTS: Only 21\% of patients had a
              diagnostic evaluation consistent with guidelines. Only 56\% of
              patients with NSCLC had mediastinal sampling prior to treatment.
              There was significant regional variability in
              guideline-consistent care (range, 12\%-29\%).
              Guideline-consistent care was associated with lower patient age,
              metropolitan areas, and if the physician ordering or performing
              the test was male, trained in the United States, had seen more
              patients with lung cancer, and was a pulmonologist or thoracic
              surgeon who had graduated more recently. More recent pulmonary
              graduates were also more likely to perform TBNA ( P < .001).
              CONCLUSIONS: Guideline-consistent care varied regionally and was
              associated with physician-level factors, suggesting that a lack
              of effective physician training may be contributing to the

              METHODS: Bronchoscopy was performed under standard conditions in
              ambulatory and hospitalised patients. Bronchoscopically invisible
              peripheral pulmonary lesions were located with 20 MHZ-EBUS-probe

              Fluoroscopy was additionally performed as required to identify
              the lesion. RESULTS: 257 patients with peripheral pulmonal
              lesions were investigated, with malignancy in 70\% of those with
              a diagnosis established. 175/257 (68.1\%) of lesions were

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Bronchoscopy is frequently practised by respiratory
              physicians, particularly when there is a suspicion of lung
              cancer. However, few guidelines are available and practice varies
              widely. BACKGROUND: Studies of current practice are few and
              unstandardised. Few data are available regarding equipment or
              procedure (information, prior investigations, environment,
              standardised reporting etc.). The evaluation of new techniques
              such as endobronchial ultrasound, autofluorescence bronchoscopy,
              transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) has been covered in
              recent publications. These evaluations are often undertaken
              without rigourous methodology (retrospective studies) but
              underline the feasibility of these techniques. Some, especially
              TBNA are nevertheless underused in practice. In the published
              studies evaluating practice the results of these investigations
              are often similar to those obtained in clinical trials even if a
              learning period is necessary. Complications are rare. Few studies
              of cost effectiveness are available but they support the use of
              these new techniques. VIEWPOINT: A national study under the aegis
              of the SLPF (French Respiratory Society) is necessary to obtain
              comprehensive and reliable data on the practice of bronchoscopy
              in the investigation of lung cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Studies
              evaluating current practices are few and unstandardised, and
              probably give only a partial survey of the success achieved and
              the difficulties encountered by respiratory physicians in their

              utilization, and hospital expenditures in 7 countries: Belgium,
              Canada, England, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, and the United
              States. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort
              study using administrative and registry data from 2010.
              Participants were decedents older than 65 years who died with
              cancer. Secondary analyses included decedents of any age,
              decedents older than 65 years with lung cancer, and decedents
              older than 65 years in the United States and Germany from 2012.
              MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Deaths in acute care hospitals, 3
              inpatient measures (hospitalizations in acute care hospitals,
              admissions to intensive care units, and emergency department
              visits), 1 outpatient measure (chemotherapy episodes), and
              hospital expenditures paid by insurers (commercial or
              governmental) during the 180-day and 30-day periods before death.
              Expenditures were derived from country-specific methods for
              costing inpatient services. RESULTS: The United States (cohort of
              decedents aged >65 years, N = 211,816) and the Netherlands (N =
              7216) had the lowest proportion of decedents die in acute care
              hospitals (22.2.\% and 29.4\%, respectively). A higher proportion
              of decedents died in acute care hospitals in Belgium (N = 21,054;
              51.2\%), Canada (N = 20,818; 52.1\%), England (N = 97,099;
              41.7\%), Germany (N = 24,434; 38.3\%), and Norway (N = 6636;
              44.7\%). In the last 180 days of life, 40.3\% of US decedents had
              an intensive care unit admission compared with less than 18\% in
              other reporting nations. In the last 180 days of life, mean per
              capita hospital expenditures were higher in Canada (US \$21,840),
              Norway (US \$19,783), and the United States (US \$18,500),
              intermediate in Germany (US \$16,221) and Belgium (US \$15,699),
              and lower in the Netherlands (US \$10,936) and England (US
              \$9342). Secondary analyses showed similar results. CONCLUSIONS
              AND RELEVANCE: Among patients older than 65 years who died with
              cancer in 7 developed countries in 2010, end-of-life care was
              more hospital-centric in Belgium, Canada, England, Germany, and
              Norway than in the Netherlands or the United States. Hospital
              expenditures near the end of life were higher in the United
              States, Norway, and Canada, intermediate in Germany and Belgium,
              and lower in the Netherlands and England. However, intensive care
              unit admissions were more than twice as common in the United
              States as in other countries.",

              was to compare end-of-life costs in Ontario, Canada, and the
              United States, using administrative health data. DESIGN:
              Advanced-stage nonsmall cell lung cancer patients who died from
              cancer at age ⩾ 65.5 years in 2001-2005 were selected from the US

              = 16,858) and the Ontario Cancer Registry (N = 8643). We
              estimated total and service-specific costs (2009 US dollars) in
              each of the last 6 months of life from the public payer
              perspectives for short-term and long-term survivors (lived < 180
              and ⩾ 180 days post-diagnosis, respectively). Services were
              defined for comparisons between systems. RESULTS: Mean monthly
              costs increased as death approached, were higher in short-term
              than long-term survivors, and were generally higher in the United
              States than in Ontario until the month before death, when they
              were similar (long-term survivors: US$10,464 and US$10,094 (p =
              0.53), short-term survivors US$14,455 and US$12,836 (p = 0.11),
              in Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare and
              Ontario, respectively). Costs for Medicare hospice and Ontario's
              palliative care components were similar and increased closer to
              death. Inpatient hospitalization was the main cost driver with
              similar costs in both cohorts, despite lower utilization in the
              United States. The compositions of many services and costs
              differed. CONCLUSION: Costs for nonsmall cell lung cancer
              patients were slightly higher in the United States than Ontario
              until 1 month before death. Administrative data allow exploration

              bronchoscopy. However, diagnostic yield is influenced by numerous
              factors. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the use of SpyGlass, a one
              millimeter diameter optic fiber, to obtain images of the distal
              mucosa and of pulmonary lesions detected with p-EBUS to determine
              if visual aspect of the distal mucosa was predictive of
              diagnosis. METHODS: We prospectively recruited subjects
              investigated for peripheral nodules. Bronchoscopy was performed
              and p-EBUS was used to locate the lesion through a guide sheath.
              The Spyglass fiber was introduced in the sheath to obtain images
              of the distal bronchial mucosa. Tissue sampling was subsequently
              done. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were enrolled in the study. A
              final diagnosis of malignancy was confirmed in 80\%. All lesions
              could be located using p-EBUS (100\%). Diagnostic sensitivity for
              p-EBUS was 58.3\%. Distal mucosa could be imaged with SpyGlass in
              14/15 patients (93.3\%). Mucosal appearance was described as
              abnormal in 7 out of the 15 subjects. Mean SpyGlass procedure

              2000 who received chemotherapy as the primary treatment,
              completed their chemotherapy and survived for at least 28 days

              (BSC) were selected. Treatment, services received, costs, and
              survival were determined by chart review and examining various
              databases including the Manitoba Cancer Registry, medical claims,
              hospitalizations, and prescription drugs. Costs of treatment,
              average cost per patient, and lifetime treatment costs were
              calculated. RESULTS: Of the 2463 patients diagnosed with NSCLC
              over the study period, 150 patients matched our study criteria.
              From the beginning of the first chemotherapy treatment, the
              median survival time was 31.8 weeks, while from the date of BSC
              the median survival time was 13.8 weeks. The average cost per
              case was $10,805 from last date of chemotherapy and $8654 during
              the BSC period. The average cost per patient-month ranged from
              $1645 to $1792 in current prices. Lifetime treatment costs ranged

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Robotic surgery was introduced as a platform for
              minimally invasive lung resection in Canada in October 2011. We
              present the first Canadian series of robotic pulmonary resection
              for lung cancer. METHODS: Prospective databases at 2 institutions
              were queried for patients who underwent robotic resection for
              lung cancer between October 2011 and June 2015. To examine the
              effect of learning curves on patient and process outcomes, data
              were organized into 3 temporal tertiles, stratified by surgeon.
              RESULTS: A total of 167 consecutive patients were included in the
              study. Median age was 66 (range 27-88) years, and 46.1\% (n = 77)
              of patients were men. The majority of patients (n = 141, 84\%)
              underwent robotic lobectomy. Median duration of surgery was 270
              (interquartile range [IQR] 233-326) minutes, and median length of
              stay (LOS) was 4 (IQR 3-6) days. Twelve patients (7\%) were
              converted to thoracotomy. Total duration of surgery and console
              time decreased significantly (p < 0.001) across tertiles, with a
              steady decline until case 20, followed by a plateau effect.
              Across tertiles, there was no significant difference in LOS,
              number of lymph node stations removed, or perioperative
              complications. CONCLUSION: The results of this case series are
              comparable to those reported in the literature. A prospective
              study to examine the outcomes and cost of robotic pulmonary
              resection compared with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery
              should be done in the context of the Canadian health care system.
              We have presented the first consecutive case series of robotic
              lobectomy in Canada. Outcomes compare favourably to other series

              microwave (MW) ablation in the treatment of lung tumors at a
              single academic medical center. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
              Retrospective review was performed of 108 patients (42 female;
              mean age, 72.5 y $\pm$ 10.3 [standard deviation]) who underwent
              computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous MW ablation for a
              single lung malignancy. Eighty-two were primary non-small-cell
              lung cancers and 24 were metastatic tumors (9 colorectal
              carcinoma, 2 renal-cell carcinoma, 4 sarcoma, 2 lung, and 7
              other). Mean maximum tumor diameter was 29.6 mm $\pm$ 17.2.
              Patient clinical and imaging data were reviewed. Statistical
              analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier modeling and logistic
              regression. RESULTS: Odds of primary technical success were 11.1
              times higher for tumors 3 cm (95\% confidence interval [CI],
              2.97-41.1; P = .0003). For every millimeter increase in original
              tumor maximal diameter (OMD), the odds of not attaining success
              increased by 7\% (95\% CI, 3\%-10\%; P = .0002). For every
              millimeter increase in OMD, the odds of complications increased
              by 3\% (95\% CI, 0.1\%-5\%; P = .04). Median time to tumor
              recurrence was 62 months (95\% CI, 29, upper bound not reached;
              range, 0.2-96.6 mo). Recurrence rates were estimated at 22\%,
              36\%, and 44\% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. Recurrence
              rates were estimated at 31\% at 13 months for tumors > 3 cm and
              17\% for those < 3 cm. Complications included pneumothorax
              (32\%), unplanned hospital admission (28\%), pain (20\%),

              underwent IRE under general anesthesia with probe placement
              performed in Fluoroscopy-CT. The IRE system employed was
              NanoKnife\textregistered{} (Angiodynamics). System settings for
              the ablation procedure followed the manufacturer's
              recommendations. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to evaluate the
              correlation of nine technical parameters with local tumor
              control. Median follow up was 12 months. RESULTS: The expected
              efficacy was not met at interim analysis and the trial was
              stopped prematurely after inclusion of 23 patients (13/10 between
              both centers). The dominant tumor entity was colorectal (n = 13).
              The median tumor diameter was 16 mm (8-27 mm). Pneumothoraces
              were observed in 11 of 23 patients with chest tubes required in 8
              (35 \%). Frequently observed alveolar hemorrhage never led to
              significant hemoptysis. 14/23 showed progressive disease (61 \%).
              Stable disease was found in 1 (4 \%), partial remission in 1 (4
              \%) and complete remission in 7 (30 \%) patients. The relative
              increase of the current during ablation was significantly higher

              presenting local recurrence (p < 0.05). Needle tract seeding was

              cancer has thwarted efforts to reduce mortality from this cancer
              through the use of screening. The advent of low-dose helical
              computed tomography (CT) altered the landscape of lung-cancer
              screening, with studies indicating that low-dose CT detects many
              tumors at early stages. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST)
              was conducted to determine whether screening with low-dose CT
              could reduce mortality from lung cancer. METHODS: From August
              2002 through April 2004, we enrolled 53,454 persons at high risk
              for lung cancer at 33 U.S. medical centers. Participants were
              randomly assigned to undergo three annual screenings with either
              low-dose CT (26,722 participants) or single-view posteroanterior
              chest radiography (26,732). Data were collected on cases of lung
              cancer and deaths from lung cancer that occurred through December
              31, 2009. RESULTS: The rate of adherence to screening was more
              than 90\%. The rate of positive screening tests was 24.2\% with
              low-dose CT and 6.9\% with radiography over all three rounds. A
              total of 96.4\% of the positive screening results in the low-dose
              CT group and 94.5\% in the radiography group were false positive
              results. The incidence of lung cancer was 645 cases per 100,000
              person-years (1060 cancers) in the low-dose CT group, as compared
              with 572 cases per 100,000 person-years (941 cancers) in the
              radiography group (rate ratio, 1.13; 95\% confidence interval
              [CI], 1.03 to 1.23). There were 247 deaths from lung cancer per
              100,000 person-years in the low-dose CT group and 309 deaths per
              100,000 person-years in the radiography group, representing a
              relative reduction in mortality from lung cancer with low-dose CT
              screening of 20.0\% (95\% CI, 6.8 to 26.7; P=0.004). The rate of

              patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer or selected
              patients with pulmonary metastases. However, for high-risk
              patients radiofrequency ablation (RFA) may offer an alternative
              option. The objective of this study was to evaluate computed
              tomography-guided RFA for high-risk patients and report our
              initial experience in 100 consecutive patients by a thoracic
              surgical service. METHODS: Medically inoperable patients were
              offered RFA. Thoracic surgeons evaluated and performed RFA under
              computed tomography guidance. Patients were followed in the
              thoracic surgery clinic. The primary end point evaluated was
              overall survival. RESULTS: One hundred patients underwent
              image-guided RFA for lung neoplasm (40 men, 60 women; median age,
              73.5 years; range, 26 to 95 years). Forty-six patients (46\%)
              with primary lung neoplasm, 25 patients (25\%) with recurrent
              cancer, and 29 patients (29\%) with pulmonary metastases
              underwent RFA. The mean follow-up for alive patients was 17
              months. The median overall survival for the entire group of
              patients was 23 months. The probabilities of 2-year overall
              survival for the entire group, primary lung cancer patients,
              recurrent cancer patients, and metastatic cancer patients were
              49\% (95\% confidence interval, 37 to 60), 50\% (95\% confidence
              interval, 33 to 65), 55\% (95\% confidence interval, 25 to 77),
              and 41\% (95\% confidence interval, 19 to 62), respectively.
              CONCLUSIONS: Our experience indicates that image-guided RFA done
              by the thoracic surgeons is feasible and safe in high-risk
              patients with lung neoplasm with reasonable results in patients
              who are not fit for surgery. Thoracic surgeons can perform RFA
              safely, and should continue to investigate this new image-guided

              performed for this purpose but its diagnostic yield is
              suboptimal. This has led to the development of new bronchoscopic
              modalities such as radial endobronchial ultrasound (R-EBUS),
              electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) and virtual
              bronchoscopy (VB). We performed this meta-analysis using data
              from previously published R-EBUS studies, to determine its
              diagnostic yield and other performance characteristics. Ovid
              MEDLINE and PubMed databases were searched for R-EBUS studies in
              September 2016. Diagnostic yield was calculated by dividing the
              number of successful diagnoses by the total number of lesions.
              Meta-analysis was performed using MedCalc (Version 16.8). Inverse
              variance weighting was used to aggregate diagnostic yield
              proportions across studies. Publication bias was assessed using
              funnel plot and Duval and Tweedie's test. 57 studies with a total
              of 7872 lesions were included in the meta-analysis. These were
              published between October 2002 and August 2016. Overall weighted
              diagnostic yield for R-EBUS was 70.6\% (95\% CI: 68-73.1\%). The
              diagnostic yield was significantly higher for lesions >2 cm in

              sign on computerized tomography (CT) scan. Diagnostic yield was
              also higher when R-EBUS probe was within the lesion as opposed to
              being adjacent to it. Overall complication rate was 2.8\%. This
              is the largest meta-analysis performed to date, assessing the

              1,000 primary cohort subjects enrolled at 29 sites in the United
              States and Europe is described. Enrollment and 24-month follow-up
              are ongoing. RESULTS: ENB index procedures were conducted for
              lung lesion biopsy (n = 964), fiducial marker placement (n =
              210), pleural dye marking (n = 17), and/or lymph node biopsy (n =

              (797/1,000). Among the 964 subjects (1,129 lesions) undergoing
              lung lesion biopsy, navigation was completed and tissue was
              obtained in 94.4\% (910/964). Based on final pathology results,
              ENB-aided samples were read as malignant in 417/910 (45.8\%)
              subjects and non-malignant in 372/910 (40.9\%) subjects. An
              additional 121/910 (13.3\%) were read as inconclusive. One-month
              follow-up in this interim analysis is not sufficient to calculate
              the true negative rate or diagnostic yield. Tissue adequacy for
              genetic testing was 80.0\% (56 of 70 lesions sent for testing).
              The ENB-related pneumothorax rate was 4.9\% (49/1,000) overall
              and 3.2\% (32/1,000) CTCAE Grade $\geq$2 (primary endpoint). The

              $\geq$4 respiratory failure rates were 1.0 and 0.6\%,

              using a bronchoscope with an outer diameter of 5-6mm under
              fluoroscopy, but the diagnostic yield can be insufficient.
              Problems with transbronchial biopsy include a limited range of
              bronchoscope insertion, difficulty in guiding a bronchoscope and
              biopsy instruments to lesions, and insufficient confirmation of
              the arrival of biopsy instruments at the target lesion; as such,
              new techniques have been used to overcome these individual
              problems. Radial-endobronchial ultrasound is used to identify
              peripheral pulmonary lesions and sampling sites. In a
              meta-analysis, the diagnostic yield, that of lesions smaller than
              2cm, and complication rate were 73, 56.3, and 1.0\%,
              respectively. Virtual bronchoscopic navigation is a method to
              guide a bronchoscope to peripheral lesions under direct vision
              using virtual bronchoscopic images of the bronchial route, and
              the diagnostic yield, that of 2-cm or smaller lesions, and
              complication rate were 73.8, 67.4, and 1.0\%, respectively.
              Electromagnetic navigation utilizes electromagnetism; the
              diagnostic yield was 64.9-71\%, and the pneumothorax complication
              rate was 4\% for this modality. Ultrathin bronchoscopes can be
              advanced to the peripheral bronchus under direct vision in
              contrast to normal-size bronchoscopes, and the diagnostic yield
              and pneumothorax complication rates were reported to be 63 and
              1.5\%, respectively. The overall diagnostic yield of these new
              techniques on meta-analysis was 70\%, a higher yield than that
              obtained with conventional transbronchial biopsy. Each technique

  abstract = "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPL) are being
              diagnosed with increasing frequency, especially with the
              increased use of chest computed tomography (CT). Depending on the
              location and size, these lesions often present a diagnostic
              challenge in terms of the low yield of traditional bronchoscopic
              biopsy techniques or the risks of a percutaneous biopsy approach.
              RECENT FINDINGS: Over the last several years, several different
              image-guided bronchoscopy techniques have emerged, including
              virtual bronchoscopic navigation, electromagnetic navigation
              bronchoscopy, radial endobronchial ultrasound, and ultrathin
              bronchoscopy. These technologies seek to improve both access and
              the diagnostic yield of PPL compared with traditional
              bronchoscopy and to perform with a lower complication rate than
              percutaneous techniques such as CT-guided trans-thoracic needle
              aspiration. SUMMARY: These advanced bronchoscopic techniques play
              an increasingly common role in the evaluation and biopsy of PPL.
              Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy and radial endobronchial
              ultrasound are the most commonly used guided techniques either in
              isolation or in combination and have the most published data
              regarding clinical experience and diagnostic yield; however, none
              of the techniques have consistently matched the yield of
              CT-guided trans-thoracic needle biopsy for PPL. Overall the
              complication rate of image-guided bronchoscopy techniques is low
              with pneumothorax being the most common adverse event.",

              airway stent placement (n = 258). Forty-two percent of procedures
              were done urgently or emergently. Complications were common
              (19.8\%), and 30-day mortality was 7.8\%, correlating with
              underlying health status and urgency of intervention. DISCUSSION:
              Prospective and ongoing data analysis for bronchoscopic
              procedures is feasible and valuable. Risk-adjusted and
              disease-specific outcomes can be documented and potentially used
              for quality assessment, benchmarking, and quality improvement
              initiatives. Appropriate use of resources and effect of
              interventions can be documented. Extending the number of

              endoscopic cryotherapy of lung tumors were systemically evaluated
              using available databases according to predefined criteria.
              RESULTS: In total, 16 publications were included in the final
              assessment. A narrative synthesis was performed because a formal
              meta-analysis was not viable due to the lack of controlled
              studies and study heterogeneity. Overall success rates for
              significant recanalization of the obstruction were approximately
              80\%, although they varied, depending on disease status in the
              patient population. Complications from the procedure developed in
              0-11.1\% of cases, most of which were minor and controlled by
              conservative management. Although limited data were available on

              (RFA) for the lung is a safe and feasible procedure without major

              evaluate the safety, effectiveness and feasibility of computed
              tomography (CT)-guided bronchoscopy cooled RFA in patients with
              medically inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS:
              Patients with pathologically diagnosed NSCLC, who had no lymph
              node involvement or distant metastases (T1-2aN0M0) but were not
              surgical candidates because of comorbidities (e.g., synchronous
              multiple nodules, advanced age, cardiovascular disease, poor
              pulmonary function, etc.) were enrolled in the present study. The
              diagnosis and location between the nearest bronchus and target
              tumor were made by CT-guided bronchoscopy before the treatment. A
              total of 28 bronchoscopy-guided cooled RFA procedures were
              performed in 20 patients. After treatment, serial CT imaging was
              performed as follow-up. RESULTS: Eleven lesions showed
              significant reductions in tumor size and 8 lesions showed
              stability, resulting in a local control rate of 82.6\%. The
              median progression-free survival was 35 months (95\% confidence
              interval: 22-45 months), and the 5-year overall survival was
              61.5\% (95\% confidence interval: 36-87\%). Three patients
              developed an acute ablation-related reaction (fever, chest pain)
              and required hospitalization but improved with conservative
              treatment. There were no other adverse events in the present
              study. CONCLUSIONS: CT-guided bronchoscopy cooled RFA is
              applicable for only highly selected subjects; however, our trial

              men and 29 women) with a median age of 76 years (range, 60-89
              years) were enrolled from 16 US centers; 51 patients were
              eligible for evaluation (they had biopsy-proven stage IA NSCLC
              and were deemed medically inoperable by a board-certified
              thoracic surgeon). Pulmonary function tests were performed within
              the 60 days before RFA and 3 and 24 months after RFA. Adverse
              events were recorded and categorized. Patients were followed with
              CT and fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. Local
              control rate and recurrence patterns were analyzed. RESULTS: The
              overall survival rate was 86.3\% at 1 year and 69.8\% at 2 years.
              The local tumor recurrence-free rate was 68.9\% at 1 year and
              59.8\% at 2 years and was worse for tumors > 2 cm. In the 19
              patients with local recurrence, 11 were re-treated with RFA, 9
              underwent radiation, and 3 underwent chemotherapy. There were 21
              grade 3 adverse events, 2 grade 4 adverse events, and 1 grade 5
              adverse event in 12 patients within the first 90 days after RFA.
              None of the grade 4 or 5 adverse events were attributable to RFA.
              There was no significant change in the forced expiratory volume
              in the first second of expiration or the diffusing capacity of
              lung for carbon monoxide after RFA. A tumor size less than 2.0 cm
              and a performance status of 0 or 1 were associated with
              statistically significant improved survival of 83\% and 78\%,
              respectively, at 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: RFA is a single, minimally
              invasive procedure that is well tolerated in medically inoperable
              patients, does not adversely affect pulmonary function tests, and
              provides a 2-year overall survival rate that is comparable to the

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Transoral surgery is an increasingly
              frequent treatment modality for tumors of the upper aerodigestive
              tract. This is in large part related to the introduction of
              transoral robotic surgery (TORS) for oropharyngeal cancer
              resection, which has demonstrated excellent oncologic and
              functional outcomes. There is limited data, however, on how TORS
              compares to traditional open surgery in overall costs and length
              of hospitalization. With increasing pressure to contain and
              reduce the costs of medical care, we sought to evaluate the
              impact of TORS on a national sample of patients undergoing
              surgery for oropharyngeal cancer. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective
              cross-sectional study. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of
              9,601 patients who underwent an extirpative procedure for a
              malignant oropharyngeal neoplasm in 2008 to 2009 was performed
              using discharge data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample.
              RESULTS: TORS was performed in 116 (1.2\%) of cases. TORS
              patients had a lower rate of gastrostomy tube placement (0\% vs.
              19\%), tracheotomy tube placement (0\% vs. 36\%), and nonroutine
              discharge (0\% vs. 44\%) compared to patients undergoing non-TORS
              procedures. After controlling for all other variables, including
              comorbidity, extent of surgery, and teaching hospital status,
              TORS was associated with significantly decreased length of
              hospitalization (mean, -1.5 days) and hospital-related costs
              (mean, -\$4,285). CONCLUSIONS: TORS is becoming an increasingly
              frequent technique to treat tumors of the upper aerodigestive
              tract. These data demonstrate that TORS is associated with a
              decreased length of hospitalization and hospital-related costs
              compared to other surgical techniques.",

  author   = "K{\"o}ckerling, Ferdinand",
  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Laparoscopic surgery is subject to certain
              limitations that can be a problem when performing complex
              minimally invasive operations. Robotic surgery was developed
              precisely to overcome such technical limitations. The question
              therefore arises whether robotic surgery leads to significantly
              better results compared with standard laparoscopic surgery.
              METHODS: Based on comparative systematic reviews and
              meta-analyses, this paper examines whether the robotic technique
              when used for abdominal and visceral surgery procedures confers
              advantages on the patient compared with the standard laparoscopic
              technique. RESULTS: Even for demanding visceral surgery
              procedures, the perioperative complication rate for robotic
              surgery is not higher than for open or laparoscopic surgical
              procedures. In cancer cases, the oncological accuracy of robotic
              resection for gastric, pancreatic, and rectal resection is seen
              to be adequate. Only the operating time is generally longer than
              for standard laparoscopic and open procedures. But, on the other
              hand, in some procedures blood loss is less, conversion rates are
              lower and hospital stay shorter. CONCLUSION: To evaluate the
              future role of the robotic technique for visceral surgery,
              high-quality prospective randomized trials are urgently needed.",

              the challenges associated with accessing nodules for diagnosis
              and therapy. Transoral access is preferred to percutaneous access
              since it has a lower risk of lung collapse, yet many sites are
              currently unreachable transorally due to limitations with current
              bronchoscopic instruments. Toward this end, we present a new
              robotic system for image-guided trans-bronchoscopic lung access.
              The system uses a bronchoscope to navigate in the airway and
              bronchial tubes to a site near the desired target, a concentric
              tube robot to move through the bronchial wall and aim at the
              target, and a bevel-tip steerable needle with magnetic tracking
              to maneuver through lung tissue to the target under closed-loop
              control. In this work, we illustrate the workflow of our system
              and show accurate targeting in phantom experiments. Ex vivo
              porcine lung experiments show that our steerable needle can be
              tuned to achieve appreciable curvature in lung tissue. Lastly, we
              present targeting results with our system using two scenarios

               consist of soft materials or are actuated by electrically
               activated materials. There are several advantages of soft robots
               compared to the conventional robots; safe human-machine
               interaction, adaptability to wearable devices, simple gripping
               system, and so on. Due to the unique features and advantages,
               soft robots have a considerable range of applications. This
               article reviews state-of-the-art researches on soft robots and
               application areas. Actuation systems for soft robots can be
               categorized and analyzed into three types: variable length
               tendon, fluidic actuation, and electro-active polymer (EAP). The
               deformable property of soft robots restricts the use of many
               conventional rigid sensors such as encoders, strain gauges, or
               inertial measurement units. Thus, contactless approaches for
               sensing and/or sensors with low modulus are preferable for soft
               robots. Sensors include low modulus (< 1 MPa) elastomers with
               liquid-phase material filled channels and are appropriate for
               proprioception which is determined by the degree of curvature.
               In control perspective, novel control idea should be developed

                 guaranteeing the reliable design of products in meeting the
                 target service life. Life testing data collected from
                 experiments are important for the validation of time-dependent
                 models. However, directly collecting life data for model
                 validation at the operating stress level is usually
                 time-consuming and expensive. In order to overcome this
                 challenge, the accelerated life testing (ALT) method is
                 employed in the proposed method to collect data for model
                 validation. The connection between ALT and model validation is
                 established first; then a VEDO model is developed using the
                 prior information obtained from the computer simulation model.
                 In the VEDO model, the information gain for model validation
                 is maximized within the testing budget and available testing
                 chamber constraints. The obtained optimal number of tests and
                 testing stress levels are designed to maximize the confidence
                 in the validation results. Various sources of uncertainty such
                 as prediction uncertainty, uncertainty of prior information,
                 and observation errors are included within the optimization

              robotics is a new technology that holds significant promise.
              Robotic surgery is often heralded as the new revolution, and it
              is one of the most talked about subjects in surgery today. Up to
              this point in time, however, the drive to develop and obtain
              robotic devices has been largely driven by the market. There is
              no doubt that they will become an important tool in the surgical
              armamentarium, but the extent of their use is still evolving.

              Articles describing the history and development of surgical
              robots were identified as were articles reporting data on
              applications. RESULTS: Several centers are currently using
              surgical robots and publishing data. Most of these early studies
              report that robotic surgery is feasible. There is, however, a
              paucity of data regarding costs and benefits of robotics versus
              conventional techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Robotic surgery is still in
              its infancy and its niche has not yet been well defined. Its

              with a new flexible nitinol peripheral TBNA needle specifically
              designed for such sampling. METHODS: Retrospective case review
              describing the first clinical cases performed with a commercially
              available 21-G peripheral TBNA device in 4 centers. RESULTS:
              Eleven different operators performed 40 procedures for PLNs of a
              mean size of 35.1 mm ($\pm$18), and located 18.8 mm ($\pm$18.8)
              from the pleural surface, with 50\% of them being present in the
              upper lobes. Bronchoscopists rated the use of the needle as good
              or excellent for reaching the PLN in 27/30 (90\%) of cases. The
              TBNA sample was diagnostic in 18/40 cases (45\%) overall and in
              18/28 (64.3\%) of cases where a diagnosis on bronchoscopy was
              possible. No episode of pneumothorax, significant bleeding,

              available clinical outcomes of robotic LESS (R-LESS) has
              considerably grown since the pioneering description of the first
              successful clinical series of single-port robotic procedures. So
              far, a cumulative number of roughly 150 robotic urologic LESS
              cases have been reported by different institutions across the
              globe with a variety of techniques and port configurations. The
              feasibility of robot-assisted single-incision colorectal
              procedures, as well as of many gynecologic procedures, has also
              been demonstrated. A novel set of single-site instruments
              specifically dedicated to LESS is now commercially available for
              use with the da Vinci Si surgical system, and both experimental
              and clinical use have been reported. However, the current robotic
              systems were specifically designed for LESS. The ideal robotic
              platform should have a low external profile, the possibility of
              being deployed through a single access site, and the possibility
              of restoring intra-abdominal triangulation while maintaining the
              maximum degree of freedom for precise maneuvers and strength for
              reliable traction. Several purpose-built robotic prototypes for
              single-port surgery are being tested. CONCLUSIONS: Significant
              advances have been achieved in the field of R-LESS since the
              first reported clinical series in 2009. Given the several
              advantages offered by current the da Vinci system, it is likely
              that its adoption in this field will increase. The recent
              introduction of purpose-built instrumentation is likely to
              further foster the application of robotics to LESS. However, we
              are still far from the ideal robotic platform. Significant
              improvements are needed before this technique might reach
              widespread adoption beyond selected centers. Further advances in
              the field of robotic technology are expected to provide the
              optimal interface to facilitate LESS.",

  abstract = "Following an extensive literature search and a consensus
              conference with subject matter experts the following conclusions
              can be drawn: 1. Robotic surgery is still at its infancy, and
              there is a great potential in sophisticated electromechanical
              systems to perform complex surgical tasks when these systems
              evolve. 2. To date, in the vast majority of clinical settings,
              there is little or no advantage in using robotic systems in
              general surgery in terms of clinical outcome. Dedicated
              parameters should be addressed, and high quality research should
              focus on quality of care instead of routine parameters, where a
              clear advantage is not to be expected. 3. Preliminary data
              demonstrates that robotic system have a clinical benefit in
              performing complex procedures in confined spaces, especially in
              those that are located in unfavorable anatomical locations. 4.
              There is a severe lack of high quality data on robotic surgery,
              and there is a great need for rigorously controlled, unbiased
              clinical trials. These trials should be urged to address the
              cost-effectiveness issues as well. 5. Specific areas of research
              should include complex hepatobiliary surgery, surgery for gastric
              and esophageal cancer, revisional surgery in bariatric and upper
              GI surgery, surgery for large adrenal masses, and rectal surgery.
              All these fields show some potential for a true benefit of using
              current robotic systems. 6. Robotic surgery requires a specific
              set of skills, and needs to be trained using a dedicated,
              structured training program that addresses the specific
              knowledge, safety issues and skills essential to perform this
              type of surgery safely and with good outcomes. It is the
              responsibility of the corresponding professional organizations,
              not the industry, to define the training and credentialing of
              robotic basic skills and specific procedures. 7. Due to the
              special economic environment in which robotic surgery is
              currently employed special care should be taken in the decision
              making process when deciding on the purchase, use and training of
              robotic systems in general surgery. 8. Professional organizations
              in the sub-specialties of general surgery should review these
              statements and issue detailed, specialty-specific guidelines on
              the use of specific robotic surgery procedures in addition to
              outlining the advanced robotic surgery training required to
              safely perform such procedures.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Emerging robotic technologies are increasingly being
              used by surgical disciplines to facilitate and improve
              performance of minimally invasive surgery. Robot-assisted
              intervention has recently been introduced into the field of
              vascular surgery to potentially enhance laparoscopic vascular and
              endovascular capabilities. The objective of this study was to
              review the current status of clinical robotic applications in
              vascular surgery. METHODS: A systematic literature search was
              performed in order to identify all published clinical studies
              related to robotic implementation in vascular intervention.
              Web-based search engines were searched using the keywords
              ``surgical robotics,'' ``robotic surgery,'' ``robotics,''
              ``computer assisted surgery,'' and ``vascular surgery'' or
              ``endovascular'' for articles published between January 1990 and
              November 2009. An evaluation and critical overview of these
              studies is reported. In addition, an analysis and discussion of
              supporting evidence for robotic computer-enhanced
              telemanipulation systems in relation to their applications in
              laparoscopic vascular and endovascular surgery was undertaken.
              RESULTS: Seventeen articles reporting on clinical applications of
              robotics in laparoscopic vascular and endovascular surgery were
              detected. They were either case reports or retrospective patient
              series and prospective studies reporting laparoscopic vascular
              and endovascular treatments for patients using robotic
              technology. Minimal comparative clinical evidence to evaluate the
              advantages of robot-assisted vascular procedures was identified.
              Robot-assisted laparoscopic aortic procedures have been reported
              by several studies with satisfactory results. Furthermore, the
              use of robotic technology as a sole modality for abdominal aortic
              aneurysm repair and expansion of its applications to splenic and
              renal artery aneurysm reconstruction have been described.
              Robotically steerable endovascular catheter systems have
              potential advantages over conventional catheterization systems.
              Promising results from applications in cardiac interventions and
              preclinical studies have urged their use in vascular surgery.
              Although successful applications in endovascular repair of
              abdominal aortic aneurysm and lower extremity arterial disease
              have been reported, published clinical experience with the
              endovascular robot is limited. CONCLUSIONS: Robotic technology
              may enhance vascular surgical techniques given preclinical
              evidence and early clinical reports. Further clinical studies are
              required to quantify its advantages over conventional treatments
              and define its role in vascular and endovascular surgery.",

              technique for the treatment of localized prostate cancer. In the
              United States, over 65\% of radical prostatectomies are
              robot-assisted, although the acceptance of this technology in
              Europe and the rest of the world has been somewhat slower. This
              article reviews the current literature on RARP with regard to
              oncological, continence and potency outcomes-the so-called
              'trifecta'. Preliminary data appear to show an advantage of RARP
              over open prostatectomy, with reduced blood loss, decreased pain,
              early mobilization, shorter hospital stay and lower margin rates.
              Most studies show good postoperative continence and potency with
              RARP; however, this needs to be viewed in the context of the
              paucity of randomized data available in the literature. There is
              no definitive evidence to show an advantage over standard
              laparoscopy, but the fact that this technique has reached parity
              with laparoscopy within 5 years is encouraging. Finally, evolving
              techniques of single-port robotic prostatectomy, laser-guided

                 this value remains below 1\%. Cardiac and thoracic surgeons

                 to perform more than one hundred thousand minimally invasive
                 robotic surgical procedures every year. A surgical robot can
                 be used by surgical teams on a rotational basis. The market of

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: This systematic literature review aimed to
                 evaluate and summarize the existing evidence on resource use
                 and costs associated with the diagnosis and treatment of head
                 and neck cancer (HNC) in adult patients, to better understand
                 the currently available data. The costs associated with HNC
                 are complex, as the disease involves multiple sites, and
                 treatment may require a multidisciplinary medical team and
                 different treatment modalities. METHODS: Databases (MEDLINE
                 and Embase) were searched to identify studies published in
                 English between October 2003 and October 2013 analyzing the
                 economics of HNC in adult patients. Additional relevant
                 publications were identified through manual searches of
                 abstracts from recent conference proceedings. RESULTS: Of 606
                 studies initially identified, 77 met the inclusion criteria
                 and were evaluated in the assessment. Most included studies
                 were conducted in the USA. The vast majority of studies
                 assessed direct costs of HNC, such as those associated with
                 diagnosis and screening, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgery,
                 side effects of treatment, and follow-up care. The costs of
                 treatment far exceeded those for other aspects of care. There
                 was considerable heterogeneity in the reporting of economic
                 outcomes in the included studies; truly comparable cost data
                 were sparse in the literature. Based on these limited data, in
                 the US costs associated with systemic therapy were greater
                 than costs for surgery or radiotherapy. However, this trend
                 was not seen in Europe, where surgery incurred a higher cost
                 than radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS:
                 Most studies investigating the direct healthcare costs of HNC
                 have utilized US databases of claims to public and private
                 payers. Data from these studies suggested that costs generally
                 are higher for HNC patients with recurrent and/or metastatic
                 disease, for patients undergoing surgery, and for those
                 patients insured by private payers. Further work is needed,
                 particularly in Europe and other regions outside the USA;
                 prospective studies assessing the cost associated with HNC
                 would allow for more systematic comparison of costs, and would
                 provide valuable economic information to payers, providers,
                 and patients.",

              considered as a surgical tool to enable innovative natural
              orifice or flexible access techniques. These experiences have
              exposed unique advantages but also significant challenges. Major
              current technical drawbacks in this setting relate to
              uncontrolled flexibility, inaccurate sustained target
              localization, unreliable navigation and overall platform
              instability. In striving to address existing technical
              limitations, this paper introduces a novel flexible
              hyper-redundant surgical robot and evaluates its clinical
              potential using a focused clinical application. METHOD: To assess
              utility of the device within tight confines of the human pelvis
              or peritoneal cavity, detailed laboratory workspace analysis
              experiments were undertaken using a computer-simulated model that
              incorporated anatomical data obtained via pelvic magnetic
              resonance images of eight women. Ten participants executed ninety
              usability and reliability trials on an ex vivo simulator, before
              the robot was repeatedly trialled in an in vivo porcine model.
              RESULTS: The robot demonstrated capability of targeting >90 \% of
              the anatomic region of interest. All 90 user trials were
              successfully performed without interruption or malfunction.
              Significant improvements in performance, time and motion were
              observed between first and last sets of trials (p = 0.001). In
              vivo feasibility testing affirmed robustness of the device when
              deployed within the physiological demands of a live scale
              appropriate model. CONCLUSION: Technologically advanced flexible
              operative platforms are needed to fulfil aspirations for an
              introductory era of flexible access surgery. This prototype is
              proposed as a potential future platform for robot-assisted
              flexible endoscopic surgery. Encouraging pre-clinical feasibility

              limited the evolution of minimally invasive surgical procedures
              to provide humanism and to improve surgical care for patients.
              Robotic enhancement has been proposed as a mechanism to improve
              the cost-benefit relationship for patients. To this end, we have
              used the robotic arm enhancement to minimize resource and
              personnel utilization during minimally invasive procedures. Phase
              I of our study has included the use of the robotic arm in 24
              laparoscopic hernia repairs, cholecystectomies, and nissen
              fundoplications with the surgeon as a solo surgeon, i.e., the
              primary surgeon is the only participant in the operative sterile
              field. The scrub nurse did not participate in the procedures.
              During this study, there were no technical mishaps, no
              complications related to the solo surgeon-robotic arm concept,
              and the operative times were statistically similar to equivalent
              procedures utilizing multiple personnel. The hernia repair is
              least complex and most amenable to solo surgery due to the use of
              only three access ports; cholecystectomy occasionally requires
              four access ports increasing its complexity to a measurable
              degree. Nissen fundoplication, however, requires five access
              ports and proved to be the most complex of the procedures to
              adapt successfully to solo surgery utilizing robotic arm
              enhancement. Phase II of our study has involved the use of a
              combination of technologically complex and sophisticated
              technology to improve outcomes in complex laparoscopic
              procedures. The head-mounted display, the robotic arm, and the
              harmonic scalpel have been used in 140 complex minimally invasive
              procedures; the procedures were laparoscopic spine surgery (24
              cases), laparoscopic gastric surgery (28 cases), and laparoscopic
              colon resection (88 cases). The use of these sophisticated
              technologies added safety, improved versatility, and did not
              increase the length of the operative procedures. The use of
              multiple technologies had an additive effect on the benefits.
              There were no experiences in which the technologies contributed
              to a technical complication or an adverse result for the
              patients. However, the successful use of these technologies
              requires an in depth educational experience for the surgeon and
              for the operating room team. In a further effort to improve
              efficiency and control of the visual fields during minimally
              invasive surgery, we have implemented a prototype voice
              activation, head-directed control, and instrument tracking by
              robotic arm enhancement in order to control the visual field
              through computer programming. Prototype voice activation and
              deactivation also allows instruments to be used in the visual
              field for the surgical procedure while not being used for
              tracking of the visual field. Tracking with the instrument
              utilizing a color-coded tracking system, and the head-directed
              control system have both been 100\% effective in our hands, have
              not induced errors in technical performance of procedures, and
              have shortened the time required for performance of specific
              procedural tasks. Further, this process improves versatility for
              the surgeon, increases concentration, reduces fatigue and does
              not interfere with the position of the surgeon. Areas for
              improvement which have been observed utilizing these techniques
              are (1) the use of appropriate and consistent voice activation
              terminology, (2) the proper positioning of the instrument
              tracking unit in the most appropriate locations on the video
              screen and on the instrument within the visual field, and (3) the
              appropriate use of head-directed control of the robotic arm. We
              have concluded from these experiences that the robotic technology
              will continue to reduce costs and minimize risk for patients
              undergoing minimally invasive surgical procedures; moreover,
              safety, versatility, and diminished use of resources will accrue
              utilizing the additive benefit of sequential sophisticated
              technologies requiring a simultaneous educational",

  abstract = "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article reviews literature pertaining to
              squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oropharynx and the evolution
              of transoral surgical (TOS) techniques for its management.
              Oncologists are recognizing a changing pattern in the cause of
              oropharyngeal cancer, namely the increasing incidence of
              HPV-associated tumors. An effort is underway to reduce the
              morbidity of treatment without jeopardizing survival. This is a
              timely discussion for reassessment of current standards of care
              and opening dialogue on treatment de-escalation. Transoral
              approaches including transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) and
              transoral robotic surgery (TORS) have revolutionized the surgical
              approach to SCC. RECENT FINDINGS: The incidence of HPV-related
              oropharyngeal SCC is increasing at epidemic rates. Although there
              are no studies comparing nonsurgical treatment to TOS in a
              randomized controlled fashion, there is an abundance of
              retrospective and prospective reports of TORS and TLM. Both early
              and advanced-stage oropharyngeal tumors can be managed
              successfully with surgery, with or without adjuvant therapy.
              SUMMARY: Although there are no hard scientific differences in
              oncologic outcomes between primary chemoradiation protocols and
              primary TOS-based approaches, retrospective comparisons support
              an advantage of primary surgery. In addition, functional outcomes
              may be superior following TOS treatment. Management of
              oropharyngeal SCC will most likely continue to be
              multidisciplinary with an ongoing effort to de-escalate treatment
              to reduce morbidity.",

  abstract = "Retrospective studies suggested that head and neck cancers
              associated with human papilloma virus (HPV) are more frequently
              cured than those caused by substance use. The Eastern Cooperative
              Oncology Group (ECOG) subsequently confirmed the observation in a
              prospective trial. Most HPV-initiated cancers arise in the
              oropharynx. Survival differences between patients with cancers
              caused by HPV and those caused by alcohol and tobacco use persist
              despite modern treatment. The impression that treatment
              intensification has resulted in improved survivorship may well be
              attributable to an increasing proportion of patients with cancers
              caused by HPV infection. Unsatisfactory results for cancers
              attributable to substance use and encouraging improvements in
              tumor control for patients with HPV-initiated cancers have led to
              dissatisfaction with the current nonsurgical management paradigm.
              Ongoing advances in surgical techniques permit transoral
              resection of oropharyngeal cancers, thus limiting
              exposure-related morbidity and permitting ready recovery in terms
              of speech and swallowing. Transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) is
              increasingly employed and transoral robotic surgery (TORS) has
              dramatically popularized surgical treatment of oropharyngeal
              cancers. Resection affords the opportunity to increase local
              control at the primary site and surgical management of neck
              allows risk-based stratification of postoperative radiation
              therapy. Case series from several institutions show encouraging
              results. Transoral surgical resection is safe, can be undertaken
              with acceptable morbidity, and provides comparable locoregional
              control to that achieved with chemoradiation. Prospective trials
              for patients with HPV-initiated cancers, as well as those
              referable to substance use, are underway.",

              further development of keyhole transcranial endoscope-assisted
              microsurgery, utilizing smaller craniotomies and minimizing
              exposure and manipulation of unaffected brain tissue. Although
              such approaches offer the possibility of shorter operating times,
              reduced morbidity and mortality, and improved long-term outcomes,
              the technical skills required to perform such surgery are
              inevitably greater than for traditional open surgical techniques,
              and they have not been widely adopted by neurosurgeons. Surgical
              robotics, which has the ability to improve visualization and
              increase dexterity, therefore has the potential to enhance
              surgical performance. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of surgical
              robots in keyhole transcranial endoscope-assisted microsurgery.
              METHODS: The technical challenges faced by surgeons utilizing
              keyhole craniotomies were reviewed, and a thorough appraisal of
              presently available robotic systems was performed. RESULTS:
              Surgical robotic systems have the potential to incorporate
              advances in augmented reality, stereoendoscopy, and jointed-wrist
              instruments, and therefore to significantly impact the field of
              keyhole neurosurgery. To date, over 30 robotic systems have been
              applied to neurosurgical procedures. The vast majority of these
              robots are best described as supervisory controlled, and are
              designed for stereotactic or image-guided surgery. Few
              telesurgical robots are suitable for keyhole neurosurgical
              approaches, and none are in widespread clinical use in the field.
              CONCLUSION: New robotic platforms in minimally invasive
              neurosurgery must possess clear and unambiguous advantages over
              conventional approaches if they are to achieve significant

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Flexible bronchoscopy is routinely utilized in the
              diagnosis and treatment of various lung diseases. Nondiagnostic
              bronchoscopy leads to more invasive interventions, such as
              transthoracic needle aspiration, mediastinoscopy or even
              thoracotomy. Electromagnetic navigation is a novel technology
              that facilitates approaching peripheral lung lesions, which are
              difficult to sample by conventional means. The navigation system
              involves creating an electromagnetic field around the chest and
              localizing an endoscopic tool using a microsensor overlaid upon
              previously acquired CT images. OBJECTIVES: To determine the
              practicality, accuracy and safety of real-time electromagnetic
              navigation, coupled with previously acquired 3D CT images, in
              locating artificially created peripheral lung lesions in a swine
              model. METHODS: Peripheral lung lesions were created in four
              swine models by insertion of a metal tube (1 x 10 mm) via a
              transthoracic approach. An electromagnetic field was created by
              placing the animal on an electromagnetic location board. A
              position sensor incorporated into the distal tip of a dedicated
              tool was used to navigate to the various target lesions.
              Information gathered in real time during bronchoscopy was
              presented on a monitor simultaneously by displaying previously
              acquired CT images. Upon reaching the target lesion, biopsies
              were performed and the functionality and safety of the
              superDimension/Bronchus System was observed and documented.
              RESULTS: The registration accuracy expressed by the fiducial
              target registration error, expressing both the registration
              quality and the stability of fiducial (registration) points, was
              4.5 mm on average. No adverse effects, such as pneumothorax or
              internal bleeding, were encountered in any of the animals in this
              study. CONCLUSIONS: Real-time electromagnetic positioning
              technology coupled with previously acquired CT images is an
              accurate technology added to standard bronchoscopy to assist in
              reaching peripheral lung lesions and performing biopsies.",

  abstract = "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) has seen
              substantial surge since its introduction in around 2007. Although
              initially described for cancer of the oropharynx, advances in
              robotic instrumentation and endoscopy have allowed for
              application of TORS toward laryngeal cancer. This review
              discusses the recent published experience of TORS for laryngeal
              cancer. RECENT FINDINGS: TORS supraglottic laryngectomy continues
              to be the most frequent application of robotic surgery for
              laryngeal cancer. A number of case series have described the
              positive experience with TORS supraglottic laryngectomy with both
              oncologic and functional outcomes rivaling alternative therapy
              options. TORS total laryngectomy also continues to be applied in
              selective cases for laryngeal cancer. The objectives of TORS
              total laryngectomy is to reduce the size of the resultant
              pharyngotomy and to limit the lateral exposure of the cervical
              vessels. Although limited in numbers, TORS total laryngectomy
              appears to be a technique of increasing application. TORS
              approach for primary glottic cancer has also been described in
              limited case series. Although the majority of patients
              demonstrated positive outcomes following TORS glottic cordectomy,
              this technique may still require additional advancement of
              robotic technology before widespread application is seen.
              SUMMARY: A TORS approach for laryngeal cancer is increasing in
              application and utility. The major surgical procedures described
              to date include supraglottic laryngectomy, total laryngectomy,
              and glottic cordectomy with promising results.",

  abstract = "Robotic mitral valve repair began in 1998 and has advanced
              remarkably. It arose from an interest in reducing patient trauma
              by operating through smaller incisions with videoscopic
              assistance. In the United States, following two clinical trials,
              the FDA approved the daVinci Surgical System in 2002 for
              intra-cardiac surgery. This device has undergone three
              iterations, eventuating in the current daVinci XI. At present it
              is the only robotic device approved for mitral valve surgery.
              Many larger centers have adopted its use as part of their routine
              mitral valve repair armamentarium. Although these operations have
              longer perfusion and arrest times, complications have been either
              similar or less than other traditional methods. Preoperative
              screening is paramount and leads to optimal patient selection and
              outcomes. There are clear contraindications, both relative and
              absolute, that must be considered. Three-dimensional (3D)
              echocardiographic studies optimally guide surgeons in operative
              planning. Herein, we describe the selection criteria as well as
              our operative management during a robotic mitral valve repair.
              Major complications are detailed with tips to avoid their
              occurrence. Operative outcomes from the author's series as well
              as those from the largest experiences in the United States are

              effective, as well as economically reasonable due to lower costs
              of hospitalization. Thus, the future of this operative technique

               A way to avoid buckling is not to push the tip from behind, but
               to use the friction with the intestinal wall to pull the tip
               forward. This paper describes the state-of-the-art in research
               on intestinal locomotion methods and presents a new locomotion
               method based on a rolling donut that is positioned around the
               endoscope tip. The donut functions like a circular caterpillar
               and is constructed from three stents that generate high friction
               with the intestinal wall. The diameter of the donut can be
               changed and the stents can be driven independently to reduce
               slip in intestinal curves. The resulting Rolling-Stent Endoscope
               contains a new steerable mechanism by which the tip can be bent
               in all directions over a very large angle. The Rolling-Stent
               Endoscope was applied for a patent and a prototype is under
               development for evaluation in the intestine of a pig.",

              integration of laparoscopic minimally invasive surgery techniques
              with endoscopic technology. Despite the advances in NOTES
              technology, the approach presents several unique instrumentation
              and technique-specific challenges. Current flexible endoscopy
              platforms for NOTES have several drawbacks including limited
              stability, triangulation and dexterity, and lack of adequate
              visualization, suggesting the need for new and improved
              instrumentation for this approach. Much of the current focus is
              on the development of flexible endoscopy platforms that
              incorporate robotic technology. An alternative approach to access
              the abdominal viscera for either a laparoscopic or NOTES
              procedure is the use of small robotic devices that can be
              implanted in an intracorporeal manner. Multiple, independent,
              miniature robots can be simultaneously inserted into the
              abdominal cavity to provide a robotic platform for NOTES surgery.
              The capabilities of the robots include imaging, retraction,
              tissue and organ manipulation, and precise maneuverability in the
              abdominal cavity. Such a platform affords several advantages
              including enhanced visualization, better surgical dexterity and
              improved triangulation for NOTES. This review discusses the
              current status and future perspectives of this novel miniature
              robotics platform for the NOTES approach. Although these

  abstract = "Over the last several decades, development of various imaging
              techniques such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance
              imaging, and positron emission tomography greatly facilitated the
              early detection of cancer. Another important aspect that is
              closely related to the survival of cancer patients is complete
              tumor removal during surgical resection. The major obstacle in
              achieving this goal is to distinguish between tumor tissue and
              normal tissue during surgery. Currently, tumor margins are
              typically assessed by visual assessment and palpation of the
              tumor intraoperatively. However, the possibility of microinvasion
              to the surrounding tissues makes it difficult to determine an
              adequate tumor-free excision margin, often forcing the surgeons
              to perform wide excisions including the healthy tissue that may
              contain vital structures. It would be ideal to remove the tumor
              completely, with minimal safety margins, if surgeons could see
              precise tumor margins during the operation. Molecular imaging
              with optical techniques can visualize the tumors via fluorophore
              conjugated probes targeting tumor markers such as proteins and
              enzymes that are upregulated during malignant transformation.
              Intraoperative use of this technique may facilitate complete
              excision of the tumor and tumor micromasses located beyond the
              visual capacity of the naked eye, ultimately improving the

                 the abilities for robots to grow, evolve, self-heal, develop,

              provide a human with intuitive and effective means for directly
              controlling these microrobotic systems. In this respect, haptic
              feedback is widely believed to be a valuable tool in
              human-in-the-loop teleoperation systems. This article presents a
              review of the literature on haptic feedback systems for
              microrobotics, categorizing it according to the type of haptic
              technology employed. In particular, we considered both tethered
              and untethered systems, including applications of
              micropositioning, microassembly, minimally invasive surgery,
              delivery of objects, micromanipulation, and injection of cells.
              One of the main challenges for an effective implementation is
              stability control. In fact, the high scaling factors introduced
              to match variables in the macro and the micro worlds may
              introduce instabilities. Another challenge lies in the
              measurement of position and force signals in the remote
              environment. The integration of microsized sensors may
              significantly increase the complexity and cost of tools
              fabrication. To overcome the lack of force-sensing, vision seems
              a promising solution. Finally, although the literature on haptic
              feedback for untethered microrobotics is still quite small, we
              foreseen a great development of this field of research, thanks to
              its flexible applications in biomedical engineering scenarios.",

              organ: Precisely controlled by the interplay of electrical and
              mechanical fields, it consists of four chambers and four valves,
              which act in concert to regulate its filling, ejection, and
              overall pump function. While numerous computational models exist
              to study either the electrical or the mechanical response of its
              individual chambers, the integrative electro-mechanical response
              of the whole heart remains poorly understood. Here we present a
              proof-of-concept simulator for a four-chamber human heart model
              created from computer topography and magnetic resonance images.
              We illustrate the governing equations of excitation--contraction
              coupling and discretize them using a single, unified finite
              element environment. To illustrate the basic features of our
              model, we visualize the electrical potential and the mechanical
              deformation across the human heart throughout its cardiac cycle.
              To compare our simulation against common metrics of cardiac
              function, we extract the pressure--volume relationship and show

              ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) and real-time
              endobronchial ultrasounds transbronchial needle aspiration
              (EBUS-TBNA) are accurate, minimally invasive and safe diagnostic
              techniques for mediastinal staging. Because of the different
              accessibility to the mediastinum, they are considered
              complementary and their combination increases the diagnostic
              yield as compared with the either alone. Recent studies have
              shown that endosonography represents the best initial test for
              invasive mediastinal evaluation in NSCLC. Endoscopic ultrasound
              (with bronchoscope)-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-B-FNA) is
              a recently introduced procedure consisting of a transesophageal
              needle aspiration using an ultrasound bronchoscope. It allows to
              perform both transbronchial and transesophageal needle sampling
              with the same instrument, in the same session and by one operator
              only, thus maximizing time and costs savings. In a recent study
              Oki et al. randomized 110 patients with hilar/mediastinal
              adenopathies or lung abnormalities adjoining both the esophagus
              and the bronchi, to undergo EBUS-TBNA or EUS-FNA performed by
              pulmonologists with an echobronchoscope. The Authors demonstrated
              that both procedures provide a high diagnostic yield, without any
              difference in the number of adverse events and a good comparable
              tolerance. Nevertheless, the transesophageal approach guaranteed
              a significantly lower dose of anesthetics and sedatives, a
              shorter procedural time, fewer oxygen desaturations, a
              significantly lower cough score and a higher operator
              satisfaction. In this review our aim was to discuss the findings
              by Oki et al. in the context of medical literature, highlighting
              the importance of the EUS-B needle aspiration technique in
              diagnosing mediastinal and lung lesions, when EBUS-TBNA is deemed
              less suitable. Finally, we pointed out the importance of

  abstract = "One of the fastest growing areas within psychology is the field
              of emotion regulation. However, enthusiasm for this topic
              continues to outstrip conceptual clarity, and there remains
              considerable uncertainty as to what is even meant by ``emotion
              regulation.'' The goal of this review is to examine the current
              status and future prospects of this rapidly growing field. In the
              first section, I define emotion and emotion regulation and
              distinguish both from related constructs. In the second section,
              I use the process model of emotion regulation to selectively
              review evidence that different regulation strategies have
              different consequences. In the third section, I introduce the
              extended process model of emotion regulation; this model
              considers emotion regulation to be one type of valuation, and
              distinguishes three emotion regulation stages (identification,
              selection, implementation). In the final section, I consider five
              key growth points for the field of emotion regulation.",

              The result is obtained by using a rigid hollow split sheath for
              the scope. The split sheath has two separate channels. One
              channel is for irrigation and the cleaning fluid flows through

              for suction to remove the solution and debris during and after
              the cleaning. Control buttons located at the operator's end
              activate the irrigation and suction functions. The control
              buttons for irrigation and suction are fabricated into an

              state-of-the-art asymmetric-tip robotic needle steering systems

              presents the design and development of a highly articulated
              needle that enables distributed RFA in liver tissue under
              ultrasound (US) image guidance. Our new needle design attains the
              target curvature required for liver procedures while meeting
              important clinical requirements, such as the use of fixed
              diameter needle introducers, presence of a free needle working
              channel, robustness for repeated insertions, and conductivity for
              the delivery of RF current for tissue ablation. The new needle

              Nitinol asymmetric flexure joint, which allows for an active
              amplification of the needle steering force, and a steel
              back-bevel tip profile, which decreases the risk of needle

              average radius of minimum curvature in ex vivo liver tissue was
              found to be 33.6 mm, the smallest reported to date. Furthermore,
              RFA in ex vivo porcine liver tissue tests were performed to

              lack of real-time three-dimensional (3D) localization and
              position updating: they are still navigated based on
              two-dimensional (2D) X-ray fluoroscopic projection images. Our
              goal was to evaluate whether incorporating an electromagnetic
              (EM) sensor on a robotic catheter tip could improve endovascular
              navigation. METHODS: Six users were tasked to navigate using a
              robotic catheter with incorporated EM sensors in an aortic
              aneurysm phantom. All users cannulated two anatomic targets (left
              renal artery and posterior ``gate'') using four visualization
              modes: (1) standard fluoroscopy mode (control), (2) 2D
              fluoroscopy mode showing real-time virtual catheter orientation
              from EM tracking, (3) 3D model of the phantom with
              anteroposterior and endoluminal view, and (4) 3D model with
              anteroposterior and lateral view. Standard X-ray fluoroscopy was
              always available. Cannulation and fluoroscopy times were noted
              for every mode. 3D positions of the EM tip sensor were recorded
              at 4 Hz to establish kinematic metrics. RESULTS: The EM
              sensor-incorporated catheter navigated as expected according to
              all users. The success rate for cannulation was 100\%. For the
              posterior gate target, mean cannulation times in minutes:seconds
              were 8:12, 4:19, 4:29, and 3:09, respectively, for modes 1, 2, 3
              and 4 (P = .013), and mean fluoroscopy times were 274, 20, 29,
              and 2 seconds, respectively (P = .001). 3D path lengths, spectral
              arc length, root mean dimensionless jerk, and number of
              submovements were significantly improved when EM tracking was
              used (P < .05), showing higher quality of catheter movement with
              EM navigation. CONCLUSIONS: The EM tracked robotic catheter
              allowed better real-time 3D orientation, facilitating navigation,
              with a reduction in cannulation and fluoroscopy times and
              improvement of motion consistency and efficiency.",

              delimiting and defining the problem, the challenge is to find the
              best solution. Ergonomics for design relates to the present and

              the functional requirements, the challenge is to do the best

              does not come with a demand and a client. It is turned towards
              the creation of future things that have not been identified yet.
              Here the challenge is to detect existing user needs or anticipate
              future ones, and imagine solutions. These three categories of

               a clear position for the use of prospective in this discipline.
               We propose to structure ergonomic activities around corrective,
               preventive (design) and prospective ergonomics, where the latter
               looks forward in time to defining human needs and activities so
               as to create human-centered artifacts that are useful and
               provide a positive user experience. The place of prospective
               ergonomics is upstream of projects, before a problem or request
               is raised by a client, and before projects exist. We describe
               several characteristics of prospective ergonomics and compare
               them with those of corrective and preventive ergonomics. We show
               that prospective ergonomics has major impacts on education and
               practice, since ergonomists should not only be trained as human
               factor experts but also as strategists to reflect on the future
               and as project managers. Prospective ergonomics requires the
               ``intelligence analysis'' of a lot of data and experts'
               opinions, as well as perspicacity, intuition, creativity,
               motivation and initiative. It represents a huge potential for
               the advancement and evolution of ergonomics and for the

  abstract = "Background The benefits of drug therapy to diabetic patients in
              terms of glycemic control, microvascular complications,
              cardiovascular event risk, mortality, and quality of life have
              been well established by clinical trial data. However, it has
              been a challenge to quantify the relationship between adherence
              and outcomes such as glycemic control, disease-related events,
              hospitalizations, cost, and quality of life. Objective This
              article provides a comprehensive summary of empirical studies
              that examine the associations between adherence and glycemic
              control, health care utilization, quality of life, and mortality
              in patients with diabetes. It is intended to provide a framework
              for researchers interested in conducting studies to improve their
              understanding of the value of medication adherence for patients
              with diabetes. Methods Relevant published articles were
              identified through searches of the National Center for
              Biotechnology PubMed database. Medical subject heading (MESH)
              terms diabetes mellitus, hypoglycemic agents, and insulin, were
              each combined with the MESH term medication adherence and with
              the subheadings economics, prevention and control, psychology,
              statistics and numerical data, therapy, adverse effects,
              therapeutic use, and administration and dosage, where available.
              Studies were included if they met the following criteria: (1)
              analyzed empirical data on some measure of patient adherence to
              diabetes pharmacotherapy; (2) described methods for measuring
              patient adherence; (3) evaluated economic, clinical, or
              humanistic outcomes related to diabetes; and (4) had as a goal of
              the research to evaluate the link between patient adherence and
              outcomes (as a primary or secondary objective). The data from the
              articles meeting these criteria were then abstracted, including
              mention of the specific interventions being compared, specific
              methods for measuring adherence, outcomes compared between
              adherent and nonadherent patients and how these outcomes were
              measured, and information on variables that were adjusted for in
              predictive and causal multivariable models. Results A total of 37
              articles that met all 4 criteria in this review underwent data
              extraction. Of these studies, 22 (59\%) used objective measures
              to assess adherence, with 1 study using pill counts to assess
              adherence and 21 using either pharmacy claims or similar refill
              records to assess refill behavior. The remaining 15 (41\%)
              studies used a wide variety of subjective patient-reported
              adherence assessments. The majority (13/23 [57\%]) of the
              glycemic control studies reported that improved adherence was
              associated with better glycemic control. The ability to draw a
              distinction between adherence and glycemic control tended to
              occur more frequently [7/9 (78\%)] among studies that
              characterized adherence in terms of prescription refills compared
              with studies that used various constructs for patient-reported
              adherence measures. Conclusions Based on the literature, better
              adherence was found to be associated with improved glycemic
              control and decreased health care resource utilization. There was
              no consistent association between improved adherence and
              decreased health care costs. Little data were available on the

  abstract = "Objective: This article investigates the role of creativity in
              ergonomic design and the generic process of developing creative
              products and services. Background: Creativity is gaining
              increased emphasis in both academia and industry. More than 50
              years of research in creativity indicates that creativity is key
              to product and service innovation. Nevertheless, there is
              scarcely any comprehensive review dedicated to appraising the
              complex construct of creativity, the underlying cognitive
              process, and the role of creativity in product and service
              development. Method: We review relevant literature regarding
              creativity, creative cognition, and the engineering design
              process to appraise the role of creativity in ergonomic design
              and to construct a conceptual model of creative product and
              service development. Results: A framework of ergodesign
              creativity is advanced that highlights the central role of
              creativity in synergistically addressing the four dimensions of
              ergonomic design: functionality, safety, usability, and
              affectivity. A conceptual model of creative design process is
              then constructed that is goal oriented and is initiated by active
              problem finding and problem formulating. This process is carried
              out in a recursive and dynamic way, facilitated by creative
              thinking strategies. Conclusion: It is proposed that ergodesign
              creativity can add supplemental value to products and services,
              which subsequently affects consumer behavior and helps
              organizations gain competitive advantage. Application: The
              proposed conceptual framework of ergodesign creativity and
              creative design process can serve as the ground for future theory
              development. Propositions advanced in this study should

              (October 1, 2007--September 30, 2008). The 966-bed (now
              1,541-bed) academic medical center faced several challenges,
              including overcrowding in the Adult Emergency Department (ED);
              delays in the postanesthesia care unit, which affected the flow
              of patients through the operating rooms; pinched capacity during
              the central part of the day; and a lack of interdependent
              institutionwide coordination of patients. Methods: The Safe
              Patient Flow Steering Committee oversaw improvement efforts, most
              of which were implemented in FY 2009 (October 2008--September
              2009), through a cascade of operational meetings. Process changes
              were made in various departments, such as the Adult ED,
              Physicians/Providers, and the Bed Management Department.
              Organizationwide method changes involved standardizing the
              discharge process, using status boards for visual control, and
              improving accuracy and timeliness of data entry. Results: Between
              FY 2008 and FY 2011, YNHH experienced an 84\% improvement in
              discharges by 11:00 A.M. The average length of stay decreased
              from 5.23 to 5.05 days, thereby accommodating an additional 45

  author   = "Hickey, Tom and Dean, Kathryn and Holstein, Bjorn E",
  abstract = "Increases in the world's older population have posed a
              significant challenge to available health care resources. For
              many older people, informal initiatives represent a necessary,
              rather than an optional health care strategy in the absence of
              alternatives. Those individuals with the greatest health and
              economic dependencies are often held responsible for their
              reliance on subsidized long-term care services. This tendency to
              blame the victim appears to transcend fundamental philosophic
              differences which have traditionally distinguished some
              collectivist and individualist societies. Although health care
              has been viewed traditionally by health professionals as their
              domain, self-care and lay initiatives have recently been
              recognized by professionals as important to the health care of
              different population groups including older people. The concept
              of self-care has been used in various ways by different people to
              describe a wide range of personal health behaviors encompassing
              lay care, self-help, enlightened consumerism, and various
              preventive measures as antidotes to the impairments of old age.
              This paper reports some of the outcomes of an international
              project which reviewed geriatric self-care in different countries
              and health care systems. Various influences on the evolution of
              interest in geriatric self-care were identified including:
              similarities and differences in health care systems: demographic
              changes; cohort differences; the emergence of professionals with
              specialized training in geriatric health care; and, the salience
              of biomedical models in addressing the health problems of aging.
              The role of professionals, especially those trained in
              geriatrics, is examined with an acknowledgment of the importance
              of a self-care strategy that is independent of professional
              dominance. The increasing inadequacy of health care systems to
              deal with a burgeoning older population makes it especially
              important for professionals and consumers to work together on the
              development of health care initiatives which decrease dependency
              on formal services and support positive health behavior. As more
              people move into old age, an increasing number will be better
              informed about their own health and about the health care system,
              and also more interested in prevention and health maintenance.
              They may also be less likely to defer to the professional's
              judgment in making health care decisions. This paper concludes
              with a caution regarding self-care as a potential `two-edged
              sword.' For the somewhat healthier and better educated elderly,
              effective self-care will be an important tool of prevention,
              health maintenance, and consumer protection. For the chronically
              impaired and most dependent elderly, self-treatment may be their
              only, and often inadequate resource.",

              were performed by laser and radio-frequency resection. The
              flexible design of the compatible tools enabled a nontraumatic
              approach. Conclusion: The Flex System has the potential to
              improve surgical access to the larynx, especially in patients
              with challenging anatomy. The associated flexible instruments
              enabled completion of surgical procedures in the larynx in a
              human cadaveric model. Further clinical studies, as well as the
              development of supplemental technology and tools, are recommended
              for future clinical applications.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to evaluate three models that use
              information gathered during triage to predict, in real time, the
              number of emergency department (ED) patients who subsequently
              will be admitted to a hospital inpatient unit (IU) and to
              introduce a new methodology for implementing these predictions in
              the hospital setting. METHODS: Three simple methods were compared
              for predicting hospital admission at ED triage: expert opinion,
              na{\"\i}ve Bayes conditional probability, and a generalized
              linear regression model with a logit link function
              (logit-linear). Two months of data were gathered from the Boston
              VA Healthcare System's 13-bed ED, which receives approximately
              1,100 patients per month. Triage nurses were asked to estimate
              the likelihood that each of 767 triaged patients from that
              2-month period would be admitted after their ED treatment, by
              placing them into one of six categories ranging from low to high
              likelihood. Logit-linear regression and na{\"\i}ve Bayes models
              also were developed using retrospective data and used to estimate
              admission probabilities for each patient who entered the ED
              within a 2-month time frame, during triage hours (1,160
              patients). Predictors considered included patient age, primary
              complaint, provider, designation (ED or fast track), arrival
              mode, and urgency level (emergency severity index assigned at
              triage). RESULTS: Of the three methods considered, logit-linear
              regression performed the best in predicting total bed need, with
              a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve
              (AUC) of 0.887, an R(2) of 0.58, an average estimation error of
              0.19 beds per day, and on average roughly 3.5 hours before peak
              demand occurred. Significant predictors were patient age, primary
              complaint, bed type designation, and arrival mode (p < 0.0001 for
              all factors). The na{\"\i}ve Bayesian model had similar positive
              predictive value, with an AUC of 0.841 and an R(2) of 0.58, but
              with average difference in total bed need of approximately 2.08
              per day. Triage nurse expert opinion also had some predictive
              capability, with an R(2) of 0.52 and an average difference in
              total bed need of 1.87 per day. CONCLUSIONS: Simple probability
              models can reasonably predict ED-to-IU patient volumes based on
              basic data gathered at triage. This predictive information could
              be used for improved real-time bed management, patient flow, and
              discharge processes. Both statistical models were reasonably
              accurate, using only a minimal number of readily available

              several observations can be made. First, the incidence of these

              never returned to prescreening levels. Second, the increase in
              the relative fraction of early stage cancers has increased.
              Third, the incidence of regional cancers has not decreased at a

              be increasing the burden of low-risk cancers without
              significantly reducing the burden of more aggressively growing
              cancers and therefore not resulting in the anticipated reduction

  abstract = "A well-managed healthcare system improves the quality of the
              patient experience. However, many small healthcare clinics have
              suboptimal systems for scheduling and locating patients and
              medical staff, delaying the relay of information and creating
              poor resource and room utilization. This paper proposes a Radio
              Frequency Identification (RFID)-based Real-Time Tracking (R-RTT)
              System for optimizing small healthcare facility operations,
              enabling further optimization of throughput time, room
              utilization, and patient flow. In the proposed scenario, RFID
              readers were equipped in strategic locations throughout the
              facility. Patients and medical staff were issued personalized
              RFID tags. When they pass through the reader's interrogation
              zone, it reads their RFID tag and sends the information to a
              central computer equipped with software capable of filtering the
              RFID data into useable information. A Visual Basic Application
              (VBA) program uses the information received from the ID tags to
              display the location of the patients and staff as they move
              throughout the facility. This increases their visibility within
              the facility by allowing medical staff to determine where their
              colleagues and patients are at all times. The VBA program was
              also able to record the data in order to track the time each
              stage of the appointment process takes to complete. The recorded
              time data can be broken into processes, making it easier to
              determine if it adds value. This data can then be transformed

              180 000 people spread over a wide geographical area, both urban
              and rural. The Liverpool Care Pathway (LCP) was initially
              implemented at the hospice inpatient unit in January 2005.
              Following this, the 'LCP Pilot Project' was developed. This
              project involved the implementation of the LCP within three aged
              residential care facilities and two wards within the regional
              hospital. Included in the project was a research component to
              enable evaluation of the effectiveness of the LCP in each
              setting. This article will consider and demonstrate the use of
              process mapping (Buckman, 2003) as a quality improvement tool to
              enhance the effective implementation and sustained use of the LCP
              for the dying patient within aged residential care. Measures are
              considered that support the implementation of the LCP at an
              organisational level rather than at a purely clinical level.

              facilities may vary considerably leading to different diagnostic
              and therapeutic traditions. The second idea, related to the
              first, is that biomedicine and the hospital as its foremost
              institution is a domain where the core values and beliefs of a
              culture come into view. Hospitals both reflect and reinforce
              dominant social and cultural processes of their societies. The

              Prospective, non-randomized controlled trial. SETTING W est Winds
              Primary Health Centre, an interdisciplinary health centre that
              includes an academic family medicine practice, located in
              Saskatoon, Sask. PARTICIPANTS All patients whose pharmacies faxed
              the health centre requesting prescription renewals between
              October 2007 and February 2008 were selected to participate in
              the study. INTERVENTIONS Medication renewal requests were
              forwarded to the pharmacist (who works in the clinic part-time)
              on days when he was working (intervention group). The pharmacist
              assessed drug-therapy issues that might preclude safe and
              effective prescribing of the medication. The pharmacist and
              physician then made a collaborative decision to authorize the
              requested medication or to request additional interventions first
              (eg, perform laboratory tests). When the pharmacist was not
              working, the physicians managed the renewal requests
              independently (control group). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Medication
              renewals authorized with no recommendations, medication-related
              problems identified, new monitoring tests ordered, and new
              appointments scheduled with health providers. RESULTS A total of
              181 renewal requests were included (94 in the control group and
              87 in the intervention group). The control group had
              significantly more requests authorized with no recommendations
              (75.5\% vs 52.9\%, P = .001). Those in the intervention group had
              significantly more medication-related problems identified (26 vs
              10, P = .031); medication changes made (24 vs 10, P = .044); and
              new appointments scheduled with their family physicians (31 vs
              21, P = .049). CONCLUSION There is an improvement in medication
              management when a pharmacist collaborates with family physicians
              to prescribe medication renewals. The collaborative model created
              significantly more activity with each renewal request (ie,
              identification of medication-related problems, medication
              changes, and new appointments), which reflects an improvement in

  abstract = "Recent changes in the organisation of primary health care have
              increased the range of professionals that patients may encounter,
              leading to renewed interest in the importance of continuity of
              care. To assess whether organisational changes have had an impact
              on continuity, it is necessary to define and measure the term.
              Researchers seeking to assess continuity face many conceptual and
              practical difficulties. This article argues that it is important
              to distinguish between three distinct but related concepts:
              longitudinal continuity from a minimum number of health
              professionals, caring relationships between patients and
              professionals, and well-coordinated care between professionals.
              An evaluation of Advanced Access as a case study is used to
              illustrate how researchers need to make several value judgements
              in operationalising longitudinal continuity. These include
              whether continuity should be measured from the perspective of
              patient, doctor, or healthcare system, the types of professionals
              and consultations that should be considered, the time period to
              be assessed, the measure to be used, and also practical
              considerations about data collection. It is argued that decisions
              about these issues should be based on an underlying hypothesis
              about why continuity may be important in the particular context.
              Distinguishing between longitudinal continuity,
              patient--professional relationships, and coordinated care makes
              it possible to examine interactions between these different
              concepts, and to examine relationships with outcomes such as
              patient satisfaction and quality of care. It will also give
              greater clarity to debates about whether new models of primary

              important general practice activity. No previous research has
              systematically observed how patients and receptionists negotiate
              appointments. AIM: To observe appointment making and investigate
              patients' and professionals' experiences of appointment
              negotiations. DESIGN OF STUDY: A qualitative study using
              participant observation. SETTING: Three general practices on
              Tyneside; a single-handed practice, a practice comprising three
              doctors, and a seven-doctor practice. METHOD: Participant
              observation sessions, consisting of 35 activity recordings and 34
              periods of observation and 38 patient and 15 professional
              interviews, were set up. Seven groups of patients were selected
              for interview. These included patients attending an 'open access'
              surgery, patients who complained about making an appointment, and
              patients who complimented the receptionists. RESULTS: Appointment
              making is a complex social process. Outcomes are dependent on the
              process of negotiation and factors, such as patients'
              expectations and appointment availability. Receptionists felt
              that patients in employment, patients allocated to the practice
              by the Health Authority, and patients who did not comply with
              practice appointment rules were most demanding. Appointment
              requests are legitimised by receptionists enforcing practice
              rules and requesting clinical information. Patients volunteer
              information to provide evidence that their complaint is
              appropriate and employ strategies, such as persistence,
              assertiveness, and threats, to try and persuade receptionists to
              grant appointments. CONCLUSION: Appointment making is a complex
              social process where outcomes are negotiated. Receptionists have
              an important role in managing patient demand. Practices should be
              explicit about how appointments are allocated, including

              keep them have a negative impact on the workflow of a clinic in
              many ways. This study was conducted to identify the reasons
              patients in an urban family practice setting give for not keeping
              scheduled appointments. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were
              conducted with 34 adult patients coming to the clinic for
              outpatient care. Interviews were audiotaped and transcribed
              verbatim. A multidisciplinary team used an
              immersion-crystallization organizing style to analyze the content
              of the qualitative interviews individually and in team meetings.
              RESULTS: Participants identified 3 types of issues related to
              missing appointments without notifying the clinic staff:
              emotions, perceived disrespect, and not understanding the
              scheduling system. Although they discussed logistical issues of
              appointment keeping, participants did not identify these issues
              as key reasons for nonattendance. Appointment making among these
              participants was driven by immediate symptoms and a desire for
              self-care. At the same time, many of these participants
              experienced anticipatory fear and anxiety about both procedures
              and bad news. Participants did not feel obligated to keep a
              scheduled appointment in part because they felt disrespected by
              the health care system. The effect of this feeling was compounded
              by participants' lack of understanding of the scheduling system.
              CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that reducing
              no-show rates among patients who sometimes attend might be
              addressed by reviewing waiting times and participants'
              perspectives of personal respect.",

              Survey conducted in early 2004 of 1,662 U.S. physicians engaged
              in direct patient care selected from 3 primary care specialties
              (family practice, internal medicine, pediatrics) and 3 nonprimary
              care specialties (anesthesiology, general surgery, cardiology).
              MEASUREMENTS Self-reported frequency of e-mail communication with
              patients or other clinicians, online access to continuing medical
              education or professional journals, and use of any computerized
              decision support (CDS) during clinical care. Survey results were
              weighted by specialty and linked via practice zip codes to
              measures of area income and urbanization. RESULTS Response rate
              was 52.5\%. Respondents spent 49 ($\pm$19) (mean [$\pm$standard

              of 6 case and 9 control internal medicine (IM) and family
              practice (FP) physicians' message volume, and a survey of 5,971
              patients' web messaging with 267 providers and staff in 16
              community primary care clinics in the Sacramento, CA region.
              MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Case telephone volume was 18.2\%
              lower (P =.002) and fell 6.50 times faster than control. Case
              total telephone plus web message volume was 13.7\% lower (P

              (164/267) of providers and staff. Patients were overwhelmingly
              satisfied and providers and staff were generally satisfied; both
              found the system easy to use. Patient satisfaction correlated

              preserves the benefit of warfarin for stroke prevention while
              causing fewer intracranial and fatal haemorrhages. METHODS AND
              RESULTS: We randomized 14 264 patients with AF in a double-blind
              trial to rivaroxaban 20 mg/day [15 mg/day if creatinine clearance
              (CrCl) 30-49 mL/min] or dose-adjusted warfarin (target
              international normalized ratio 2.0-3.0). Compared with patients

              0.57-1.23] in the per-protocol population. Intention-to-treat
              analysis yielded similar results (HR 0.86; 95\% CI 0.63-1.17) to
              the per-protocol results. Rates of the principal safety endpoint

              service with a nurse discharge planner in an academic teaching
              hospital. Subjects and methods Inpatient medicine service was
              provided by hospitalists, general internists, and specialists.
              Service personnel were identical except that the hospitalist
              service also had a nurse discharge planner. Hospitalists attended
              4 months per year (compared with the 1 month by most other
              attending physicians) and had no outpatient responsibilities
              during the ward months. Patients were admitted alternately based
              on resident call schedule. Major outcomes included average costs
              of hospitalization, length of stay, and resource utilization.
              Quality measures included inpatient mortality, 30-day readmission
              rates, and satisfaction of patients, residents and students.
              Results Hospitalist-attended services had lower mean ($\pm$ SD)
              inpatient costs per patient ($4289 \pm $6512) compared with
              specialist-staffed services ($6066 \pm $7550, P < 0.0001), with a
              trend toward lower costs when compared with generalist-attended
              services ($4850 \pm $7027, P = 0.11). Hospitalist services had
              shorter mean lengths of stay (4.4 $\pm$ 4.0 days), compared with
              generalists (5.2 $\pm$ 5.2 days) and specialists (6.0 $\pm$ 5.5
              days, P < 0.0001 for hospitalists vs. both groups). Readmission
              rates were similar in all groups. Mortality rates were higher in
              the specialist group [5.0\% (44 of 874)] compared with
              hospitalists [2.2\% (18 of 829)] and generalists [2.6\% (20 of

              generalists vs hospitalists]. Satisfaction results were uniformly
              high in all groups, with no significant differences. Conclusion
              Hospitalist services with a nurse discharge planner were
              associated with lower average cost and shorter average length of

              Subjects and methods This retrospective cohort study of 10 595
              patients was conducted between July 2001 and June 2002 in a

              treated by Community Physicians, Private Hospitalists and
              Academic Hospitalists. Results There was a 20\% reduction in
              length of stay on the Academic Hospitalist service (p <.0001) and
              8\% on the Private Hospitalist service (P = .049) compared with
              Community Physicians. Similarly, total costs were 10\% less on
              the Academic (P <.0001) and 6\% less on the Private Hospitalist
              (P = .02) services compared with Community Physicians. The length
              of stay of Academic Hospitalists was 13\% shorter than that of
              Private Hospitalists (P = .002); differences in costs between

              review. A health maintenance organization mandated that all
              patients be admitted to a critical care hospitalist team. The
              family physician hospitalists admitted all other residency
              patients and patients of some community family physicians. The
              primary care physicians admitted all their other patients. We
              adjusted for disease severity by using the Pneumonia Severity
              Index, age, sex, and comorbidities. POPULATION: Adults admitted
              with pneumonia to our private urban community hospital.
              Exclusions included patients with nosocomial pneumonia, human
              immunodeficiency virus, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
              OUTCOMES MEASURED: Primary (adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities,
              and disease severity): hospital charges, length of stay,
              in-hospital mortality, readmissions, and returns to the emergency
              room. Secondary: chest radiographs, intensive care use, blood and
              sputum cultures, compliance with American Thoracic Society
              guidelines, lifestyle and end-of-life counseling. RESULTS: Of 97
              patients, 21 were admitted to the critical care hospitalists, 53
              to the family physician hospitalists, and 23 to primary care
              physicians. The mean charge (\$5680) by the primary care

              than that of the family physician hospitalists (\$7699; P=.08).
              The patients of critical care and family physician hospitalists
              had longer mean lengths of stay (critical care hospitalists, 3.8
              days; family physician hospitalists, 3.9 days) than did those of
              the primary care physicians (2.6 days; P=.04 and.01,
              respectively). Compared with the primary care physicians, the
              critical care hospitalists were more likely to obtain at least 2
              chest x-rays (odds ratio, 4.1; 95\% confidence interval,
              1.1-15.5) and trended toward increased odds of lengthy stay in

              primary or secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Claims of better and
              cheaper care by hospitalists need further investigation.

              relationship (y = -0.58x $\times$ 248). The major complication
              rate was 3.6\% $\pm$ 4.2\% and the average nodal yield was 31.3
              $\pm$ 4.1. CumulativeSum analysis showed acceptable complication
              rates and oncological results from the beginning of surgeon's
              laparoscopic career. CONCLUSION: Developing laparoscopic skills
              can provide acceptable outcomes in advanced right hemicolectomy
              for a surgeon who primarily trained in open colorectal surgery.
              Operative duration is nearly triple that reported for
              conventional laparoscopic right hemicolectomy. The slow operative
              duration learning curve without a plateau reflects complex
              anatomy and the need for careful dissection around critical
              structures. Should one wish to adopt this strategy either based
              on some available evidence of superiority or with intention to
              participate in research, one has to change the view of right
              hemicolectomy being a rather simple case to being a complex,
              lengthy laparoscopic surgery.",

              and cost of inpatient care by a family medicine teaching service
              in comparison with the hospitalists' and community physicians'
              services in the same community hospital. METHODS: We analyzed
              inpatient admissions to either a family medicine teaching service
              (FMTS), hospitalist physician group, or the patient's own primary
              care community physician in a 290-bed, for-profit, community

              included length of stay, fixed costs, variable costs, and
              readmission rate. RESULTS: A total of 5,453 hospital admissions
              were analyzed. Patients admitted to the FMTS experienced a
              significantly shorter length of stay and had significantly lower

              tool to automate the performance of regional techniques reducing
              the anesthesiologist's workload and improving patient care. The
              purpose of this review is to show the latest findings in robotic
              regional anesthesia. RECENT FINDINGS: The literature separates
              robots in anesthesia into two groups: pharmacological robots and
              manual robots. Pharmacological robots are mainly closed-loop
              systems that help in the titration of anesthetic drugs to
              patients undergoing surgery. Manual robots are mechanical robots
              that are used to support or replace the manual gestures performed
              by anesthesiologists. Although in the last decade researchers
              have focused on the development of decision support systems and
              closed-loop systems, more recent evidence supports the concept
              that robots can also be useful in performing regional anesthesia
              techniques. SUMMARY: Robots can improve the performance and
              safety in regional anesthesia. In this review, we present the
              developments made in robotic and automated regional anesthesia,

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To determine how minimally invasive surgical learning
              curves are assessed and define an ideal framework for this
              assessment. BACKGROUND: Learning curves have implications for
              training and adoption of new procedures and devices. In 2000, a
              review of the learning curve literature was done by Ramsay et al
              and it called for improved reporting and statistical evaluation
              of learning curves. Since then, a body of literature is emerging
              on learning curves but the presentation and analysis vary.
              METHODS: A systematic search was performed of MEDLINE, EMBASE,
              ISI Web of Science, ERIC, and the Cochrane Library from 1985 to
              August 2012. The inclusion criteria are minimally invasive
              abdominal surgery formally analyzing the learning curve and
              English language. 592 (11.1\%) of the identified studies met the
              selection criteria. RESULTS: Time is the most commonly used proxy
              for the learning curve (508, 86\%). Intraoperative outcomes were
              used in 316 (53\%) of the articles, postoperative outcomes in 306
              (52\%), technical skills in 102 (17\%), and patient-oriented
              outcomes in 38 (6\%) articles. Over time, there was evidence of
              an increase in the relative amount of laparoscopic and robotic
              studies (P < 0.001) without statistical evidence of a change in
              the complexity of analysis (P = 0.121). CONCLUSIONS: Assessment
              of learning curves is needed to inform surgical training and
              evaluate new clinical procedures. An ideal analysis would account
              for the degree of complexity of individual cases and the inherent
              differences between surgeons. There is no single proxy that best
              represents the success of surgery, and hence multiple outcomes

  abstract = "CONTEXT: Pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) in prostate cancer
              is the most effective method for detecting lymph node metastases.
              However, a decline in the rate of PLND during radical
              prostatectomy (RP) has been noted. This is likely the result of
              prostate cancer stage migration in the prostate-specific
              antigen-screening era, and the introduction of minimally invasive
              approaches such as robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).
              OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy, limitations, and complications
              of PLND during RARP. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A review of the
              literature was performed using the Medline, Scopus, and Web of
              Science databases with no restriction of language from January
              1990 to December 2012. The literature search used the following
              terms: prostate cancer, radical prostatectomy, robot-assisted,
              and lymph node dissection. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The median value
              of nodal yield at PLND during RARP ranged from 3 to 24 nodes. As
              seen in open and laparoscopic RP series, the lymph node
              positivity rate increased with the extent of dissection during
              RARP. Overall, PLND-only related complications are rare. The most
              frequent complication after PLND is symptomatic pelvic
              lymphocele, with occurrence ranging from 0\% to 8\% of cases. The
              rate of PLND-associated grade 3-4 complications ranged from 0\%
              to 5\%. PLND is associated with increased operative time.
              Available data suggest equivalence of PLND between RARP and other
              surgical approaches in terms of nodal yield, node positivity, and
              intraoperative and postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: PLND
              during RARP can be performed effectively and safely. The overall
              number of nodes removed, the likelihood of node positivity, and
              the types and rates of complications of PLND are similar to pure
              laparoscopic and open retropubic procedures.",

              nerve block system and its impact on learning regional
              anaesthesia skills. We compared success rates, learning curves,

              robot-assisted vs manual ultrasound (US)-guided nerve block
              needle guidance. The hypothesis of this study is that robot
              assistance will result in faster skill acquisition than manual
              needle guidance. METHODS: Five co-authors with different
              experience with nerve blocks and the robotic system performed
              both manual and robot-assisted, US-guided nerve blocks on two
              different nerves of a nerve phantom. Ten trials were performed
              for each of the four procedures. Time taken to move from a shared
              starting position till the needle was inserted into the target
              nerve was defined as the performance time. A successful block was
              defined as the insertion of the needle into the target nerve.
              Average performance times were compared using analysis of
              variance. P<0.05 was considered significant. Data presented as
              mean (standard deviation). RESULTS: All blocks were successful.
              There were significant differences in performance times between
              co-authors to perform the manual blocks, either superficial
              (P=0.001) or profound (P=0.0001); no statistical difference
              between co-authors was noted for the robot-assisted blocks.
              Linear regression indicated that the average decrease in time
              between consecutive trials for robot-assisted blocks of 1.8 (1.6)
              s was significantly (P=0.007) greater than the decrease for
              manual blocks of 0.3 (0.3) s. CONCLUSIONS: Robot assistance of
              nerve blocks allows for faster learning of needle guidance over
              manual positioning and reduces inter-subject performance

              as the introduction of the needle into the nerve sheath; motor or
              sensory block was not used to determine the success rate. The
              nerve performance time was 189 seconds (150, 233; 90, 305),
              whereas the robotic time was 164 seconds (121, 210; 73, 271).
              CONCLUSIONS: We present the first human testing of a robotic
              ultrasound-guided nerve block system. The success rate was 100\%.

              terms. All levels of evidence and types of reports were reviewed.
              RESULTS: We comprehensively reviewed technical issues,

              morbidity rates, and follow-up strategies. CONCLUSION: The
              technique is safe and effective. Tumors < 2.5 cm are
              statistically most likely to remain disease-free. Anterior tumors
              are contraindicated. Strict follow-up is needed to detect
              failures, most of which occur within 3 months and can be easily
              salvaged with repeat radiofrequency ablation. Homogeneous
              enhancement within 1 month is not necessarily a failure, and
              tends to disappear after 4 to 6 weeks. Multi-disciplinary

  abstract = "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Robots are present in surgery, to a much
              lesser extent in the field of anesthesia. The purpose of this
              review is to show the latest and most important findings in
              robotic anesthesia. Moreover, this review argues the importance
              and utility of robots in anesthesia. RECENT FINDINGS: Over the
              years, many closed-loop systems have been developed; they were
              able to control only one or two of the three components of
              anesthesia: hypnosis, analgesia, or muscle relaxation. McSleepy
              controls all three components of anesthesia, from induction to
              emergence of anesthesia. Telemedical applications have not only
              led to remote monitoring but even to remotely controlled
              anesthesia, such as transcontinental anesthesia. A new
              closed-loop system for sedation, called Sedasys, could
              revolutionize the field of nonoperating room sedation. 'Manual
              robots' are used to help and replace anesthesiologists performing
              anesthesia procedures. Specific robots for intubation and nerve
              blocks have been developed and tested in humans. SUMMARY: Robots
              can improve performance in anesthesia and healthcare. Closed-loop
              systems are the basis for pharmacological robots. Safe anesthetic
              care might be delivered through teleanesthesia whenever qualified
              personnel are not available or need support. Mechanical robots
              are being developed for anesthesia care.",

              two widely validated laparoscopic simulation programs,
              LapSim(\textregistered{}) (Surgical Science Sweden AB), and
              ProMIS(\textregistered{}) (Haptica, Ireland)for inclusion in the

              We then randomized 20 na{\"\i}ve medical students to receive
              training on either LapSim or ProMIS, both or neither, and
              evaluated them before and after training. RESULTS: When the

              (including para-aortic nodes in grade 2 and 3 tumors). RESULTS:
              At least one SLN was detected in 92\% of patients; in 66 of these
              (72\%) bilateral SLN were detected, and in 15 cases the SLN was

              videolaryngoscope via a robotic arm. Ninety intubations were
              performed by the Kepler Intubation System on an airway trainer
              mannequin by a single operator. The first group of 30 intubations
              was performed with the operator in direct view of the mannequin
              (direct view group). The second group of 30 intubations was
              performed with the operator unable to see the mannequin (indirect
              view group). Thirty semiautomated intubations were also performed
              during which the robotic system replayed a trace of a previously
              recorded intubation maneuver (semiautomated group). First-attempt

              to a three-week prehabilitation home-based program consisting of
              strength and endurance exercises as well as nutritional
              optimization. Remarkably, there were no episodes of postoperative
              confusion, and over the following eight weeks, she continued to
              show sustained improvement in exercise tolerance (as per the
              six-minute walk test), cognitive function (as per the Repeatable

              23) women were performed on the outcome measures after surgery.
              RESULTS: The mean BMI and the range in each of the BMI categories
              was 25 kg/m² (18.7-29.4 kg/m²), 34 kg/m² (30.1-38.4 kg/m²), and
              46 kg/m² (40.0-58.8 kg/m²). Women with higher BMI tended to be

              enlarged uterus, which could not be delivered safely via the

              ultrasonography with or without saline infusion
              hysterosonography. Management options depend on the patient's
              fertility potential and desire for future pregnancy. Submucous
              myoma should be treated by a hysteroscopic approach. Intramural
              and subserous myomas in women who opt for nonsurgical treatment
              could be treated with uterine artery embolization (UAE),
              high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), or medical treatment
              such as selective gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists,
              progesterone receptor modulators, or aromatase inhibitors. All
              interventions aside from hysterectomy provide temporary relief,
              although myomectomy, UAE, and HIFU provides more durable symptom
              relief relative to current medical management. Patients wishing
              to preserve their fertility are best treated by myomectomy, which
              can be done by laparoscopy. A laparoscopic approach is more
              advantageous than laparotomy, but laparoscopic suturing is more
              demanding. This can be overcome by robotic-assisted laparoscopic
              myomectomy.",

              MATERIALS: Patients without evidence of metastatic disease were
              identified. HDRBT was given before ERT with a dose of 20 Gy in 5
              fractions. Patients with a Karnofsky performance of more than 70

              ``the intubation'' as we call is not as simple as it looks. It is
              a very tricky and tedious maneuver that entails skills to assess
              and perform. Nevertheless, often this is left to the chores of
              inefficient hands due to a paucity of the availability of
              experts. They seldom are able to complete the task and often wind
              up calling the attention of the unit. The present review is an
              attempt to describe the need to undertake intubation, the
              procedures and techniques, the complications, including morbidity
              and mortality and airway management. This overview includes
              explicit descriptions of the difficult airway which represents
              multifaceted interface amid patient factors, clinical setting,
              and skills of the practitioner. Materials and Methods: To
              accomplish the target, peer-reviewed English language articles
              published during third millennium up to 2013 were selected from
              Pub Med, Pub Med Central, Science Direct, Up-to-date, Med Line,
              comprehensive databases, Cochrane library, and the Internet

              systematic search of literature on the requirements that
              necessitate the practice of intubation, different techniques that
              facilitate easy conduct of procedure, the complications,

              study compared success rates for tracheal intubation with the
              C-MAC\textregistered{} video laryngoscope (Karl Storz,
              Tuttlingen, Germany) with conventional direct laryngoscopy in
              patients with predicted difficult airway. METHODS: We conducted a
              two arm, single-blinded randomized controlled trial that involved
              300 patients. Inclusion required at least one of four predictors
              of difficult intubation. The primary outcome was successful
              tracheal intubation on first attempt. RESULTS: The use of video
              laryngoscopy resulted in more successful intubations on first
              attempt (138/149; 93\%) as compared with direct laryngoscopy
              (124/147; 84\%), P = 0.026. Cormack-Lehane laryngeal view was
              graded I or II in 139/149 of C-MAC attempts versus 119/147 in
              direct laryngoscopy attempts (P < 0.01). Laryngoscopy time
              averaged 46 s (95\% CI, 40-51) for the C-MAC group and was
              shorter in the direct laryngoscopy group, 33 s (95\% CI, 29-36),
              P < 0.001. The use of a gum-elastic bougie and/or external
              laryngeal manipulation were required less often in the C-MAC
              intubations (24\%, 33/138) compared with direct laryngoscopy
              (37\%, 46/124, P = 0.020). The incidence of complications was not
              significantly different between the C-MAC (20\%, 27/138) versus
              direct laryngoscopy (13\%, 16/124, P = 0.146). CONCLUSION: A
              diverse group of anesthesia providers achieved a higher
              intubation success rate on first attempt with the C-MAC in a
              broad range of patients with predictors of difficult intubation.

              management in intensive care unit (ICU) patients have produced
              controversial findings. The aim of this study was to critically

              orotracheal intubation (OTI) rate, first-attempt success, and
              complications related to intubation in ICU patients, compared to
              standard therapy, defined as direct laryngoscopy (DL). METHODS:
              We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized
              controlled trials, as well as prospective and retrospective
              observational studies, by searching PubMed, EMBASE, and
              bibliographies of articles retrieved. We screened for relevant
              studies that enrolled adults in whom the trachea was intubated in
              the ICU and compared VL to DL. We included studies reporting at
              least one clinical outcome of interest to perform a
              meta-analysis. We generated pooled odd ratios (OR) across
              studies. The primary outcome measure was difficult OTI. The
              secondary outcomes were first-attempt success, Cormack 3/4
              grades, and complications related to intubation (severe
              hypoxemia, severe cardiovascular collapse, airway injury,
              esophageal intubation). RESULTS: Nine trials with a total of
              2,133 participants (1,067 in DL and 1,066 in VL) were included in
              the current analysis. Compared to DL, VL reduced the risk of
              difficult OTI [OR 0.29 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.20-0.44,
              p < 0.001)], Cormack 3/4 grades [OR 0.26 (95\% CI 0.17-0.41, p <
              0.001)], and esophageal intubation [0.14 (95\% CI 0.02-0.81, p =
              0.03)] and increased the first-attempt success [OR 2.07 (95\% CI
              1.35-3.16, p < 0.001)]. No statistically significant difference
              was found for severe hypoxemia, severe cardiovascular collapse or

  abstract = "Introduction We report data from the first Utstein-style study of
              physician-provided pre-hospital advanced airway management.
              Materials and methods Anaesthesiologists from eight pre-hospital
              critical care teams in the Central Denmark Region (a mixed rural
              and urban region with 1.27 million inhabitants) prospectively
              registered data according to the template for reporting data from
              pre-hospital advanced airway management. Data collection took
              place from February 1st 2011 to October 31st 2012. Included were
              patients of all ages on whom pre-hospital advanced airway
              management was performed. The objective was to estimate the
              incidences of failed and difficult pre-hospital endotracheal
              intubation, and complications related to pre-hospital advanced
              airway management. Results The overall incidence of successful
              pre-hospital endotracheal intubation among 636 intubation
              attempts was 99.7\%, even though 22.4\% of pre-hospital
              endotracheal intubations required more than one intubation
              attempt. The overall incidence of complications related to
              pre-hospital advanced airway management was 7.9\%. Following
              rapid sequence intubation, the incidence of first pass success
              was 85.8\%, the overall incidence of complications was 22.0\%,
              the incidence of hypotension 7.3\% and that of hypoxia 5.3\%.
              Multiple endotracheal intubation attempts were associated with an
              increased overall incidence of complications. No airway
              management related deaths occurred. Discussion The overall
              incidence of successful pre-hospital endotracheal intubations
              compares to those found in other physician-staffed pre-hospital
              systems. The incidence of pre-hospital endotracheal intubations
              requiring more than one attempt is higher than suspected. The
              incidence of hypotension or hypoxia after pre-hospital rapid
              sequence intubation compares to those found in UK emergency
              departments. Conclusion Pre-hospital advanced airway management
              including pre-hospital endotracheal intubation performed by
              experienced anaesthesiologists is associated with high success
              rates and relatively low incidences of complications. An
              increased first pass success rate following pre-hospital
              endotracheal intubation may further reduce the incidence of
              complications and enhance patient safety in our system.",

              Airway Focus Group (CAFG) studied the unanticipated difficult
              airway and made recommendations on management in a 1998
              publication. The CAFG has since reconvened to examine more recent
              scientific literature on airway management. The Focus Group's
              mandate for this article was to arrive at updated practice
              recommendations for management of the unconscious/induced patient
              in whom difficult or failed tracheal intubation is encountered.
              METHODS: Nineteen clinicians with backgrounds in anesthesia,
              emergency medicine, and intensive care joined this iteration of
              the CAFG. Each member was assigned topics and conducted reviews
              of Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases. Results were
              presented and discussed during multiple teleconferences and two
              face-to-face meetings. When appropriate, evidence- or
              consensus-based recommendations were made together with assigned
              levels of evidence modelled after previously published criteria.
              CONCLUSIONS: The clinician must be aware of the potential for
              harm to the patient that can occur with multiple attempts at
              tracheal intubation. This likelihood can be minimized by moving
              early from an unsuccessful primary intubation technique to an
              alternative ``Plan B'' technique if oxygenation by face mask or
              ventilation using a supraglottic device is non-problematic.
              Irrespective of the technique(s) used, failure to achieve
              successful tracheal intubation in a maximum of three attempts
              defines failed tracheal intubation and signals the need to engage
              an exit strategy. Failure to oxygenate by face mask or
              supraglottic device ventilation occurring in conjunction with
              failed tracheal intubation defines a failed oxygenation, ``cannot
              intubate, cannot oxygenate'' situation. Cricothyrotomy must then
              be undertaken without delay, although if not already tried, an
              expedited and concurrent attempt can be made to place a

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: An adequate airway management plan is essential for
              patient safety. Recently, new tools have been developed as
              alternatives to direct laryngoscopy and intubation. Among these,
              video-laryngoscopy has enjoyed a rapid increase in popularity and
              is now considered by many as the first-line technique in airway
              management. This paradigm shift may have an impact on patient
              safety. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Studies show that video-laryngoscopes
              are associated with better glottic visualization, a higher
              success rate for difficult airways, and a faster learning curve,
              resulting in a higher success rate for intubations by novice
              physicians. Thus, unanticipated difficult intubations may be less
              frequent if video-laryngoscopy is used as the first-line
              approach. In addition, on-screen viewing by the operator creates
              a new dynamic interaction during airway management. The entire
              operating room team can assess progress in real time, which
              enhances communication and improves teaching. However, if
              video-laryngoscopes become standard tools for tracheal
              intubation, these more costly devices will need to be widely
              available in all locations where airway management is conducted.
              Furthermore, algorithms for difficult intubation will require
              modification, and the question of selecting alternate devices
              will arise. If the incidence of difficult intubation decreases,
              the lack of motivation to teach and learn the use of alternative
              devices might adversely impact patient safety. CONCLUSION: The
              greater effectiveness of video-laryngoscopes associated with
              multi-person visualization could enhance overall patient safety
              during airway management. However, the routine use of
              video-laryngoscopy also introduces some issues that need to be
              addressed to avoid potentially dangerous pitfalls.",

              review shows that in mostly elective circumstances, at least 50

              elective settings. Taking this factor into account, training
              should include a variety of exposures and should probably exceed

              video-laryngoscopy appears to provide better glottic
              visualization than direct laryngoscopy. However, it remains
              unclear if it translates into increased success with intubation.
              METHODS: We systematically searched electronic databases,
              conference abstracts, and article references. We included trials
              in humans comparing Glidescope(\textregistered{})
              video-laryngoscopy to direct laryngoscopy regarding the glottic
              view, successful first-attempt intubation, and time to
              intubation. We generated pooled risk ratios or weighted mean
              differences across studies. Meta-regression was used to explore
              heterogeneity based on operator expertise and intubation
              difficulty. RESULTS: We included 17 trials with a total of 1,998
              patients. The pooled relative risk (RR) of grade 1 laryngoscopy
              (vs $\geq$ grade 2) for the Glidescope(\textregistered{}) was 2.0
              [95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.5 to 2.5]. Significant
              heterogeneity was partially explained by intubation difficulty
              using meta-regression analysis (P = 0.003). The pooled RR for
              nondifficult intubations of grade 1 laryngoscopy (vs $\geq$ grade
              2) was 1.5 (95\% CI 1.2 to 1.9), and for difficult intubations it
              was 3.5 (95\% CI 2.3 to 5.5). There was no difference between the
              Glidescope(\textregistered{}) and the direct laryngoscope
              regarding successful first-attempt intubation or time to
              intubation, although there was significant heterogeneity in both
              of these outcomes. In the two studies examining nonexperts,
              successful first-attempt intubation (RR 1.8, 95\% CI 1.4 to 2.4)
              and time to intubation (weighted mean difference -43 sec, 95\% CI
              -72 to -14 sec) were improved using the
              Glidescope(\textregistered{}). These benefits were not seen with
              experts. CONCLUSION: Compared to direct laryngoscopy,
              Glidescope(\textregistered{}) video-laryngoscopy is associated
              with improved glottic visualization, particularly in patients

              this in airway management. US has several advantages for imaging
              of the airway - it is safe, quick, repeatable, portable, widely
              available, and it must be used dynamically for maximum benefit in
              airway management, in direct conjunction with the airway
              management, i.e. immediately before, during, and after airway
              interventions. US can be used for direct observation of whether
              the tube enters the trachea or the esophagus by placing the
              ultrasound probe transversely on the neck at the level of the
              suprasternal notch during intubation, thus confirming intubation
              without the need for ventilation or circulation. US can be
              applied before anesthesia induction and diagnose several

              and ease of transnasal passage. All other ratings were > 3.0
              (range, 3.54 to 3.87), the lowest of which was handling comfort.
              Conclusion The flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope with sterile
              single-use disposable-sheath endoscope system has the potential
              to reduce scope downtime by eliminating the need for high-level
              disinfection between procedures. Illumination, image clarity, and
              ease of insertion are very good, justifying future prospective
              studies comparing this device to conventional flexible fiberoptic

              medical center. Patients Sixty-five adult patients scheduled for
              elective surgery requiring general anesthesia. Interventions
              Patients were randomized into 2 groups. Group A (n = 33) were
              intubated using Ambu Aura-i and the Ambu aScope 2, a disposable
              flexible intubating scope, whereas those in group B (n = 33) were
              blindly intubated using the Intubating Laryngeal Mask Airway
              (ILMA). Measurements First-attempt intubation success rate,
              overall intubation success rate, time to intubation, incidence of
              airway morbidity. Main results The data demonstrated that time
              for endotracheal intubation in the ILMA group was significantly
              shorter than in the Ambu Aura-i group (P < .05). There was no
              difference in the first-attempt intubation success rate (Aura-i =
              26/33, 78.8\%; ILMA = 27/33, 81.8\%; P = .757) or the overall
              intubation success rate (Aura-i = 29/33, 87.9\%; ILMA = 31/33,
              93.9\%; P = .392) between the groups. Four patients (12\%) in the
              Ambu Aura-i group had a failed intubation; 1 was due to a failure
              of the aScope monitor, whereas 3 were due to inability to
              visualize the glottis. Two patients (7\%) in the ILMA group had a
              failed intubation due to esophageal intubation. There was no
              statistically significant difference in airway morbidity between
              the 2 groups. Conclusions The data suggest that intubation with
              the ILMA is faster but that first-attempt and overall intubation
              success rates were comparable in both groups. The results suggest
              that although the flexible intubating scope--guided Aura-i does
              not outperform blind intubation via the ILMA, the technique is

              failures and infrequent problems. In the first study, choice of
              fibrescope had an impact on the number of user-reported problems
              (p = 0.004), and user-assessed ratings of ease of endoscopy (p <

              evaluate the need for intraoperative bronchoscopy and to compare
              various surgical techniques. Methods: During 1 year all
              percutaneous tracheostomies in three intensive care units were
              prospectively documented according to a unified protocol. In one
              unit, bronchoscopy was used routinely and in others only during
              the study. Results: A total of 111 subjects (77 males) with
              median age 64 (range, 18--86) years and body mass index 25.4
              (range, 15.9--50.7) were included. In unit A, tracheal wall was
              directly exposed; in unit B, limited dissection to enable
              tracheal palpation was made. In both units, bronchoscopy was used
              to check the location of an already inserted guiding needle;
              needle position required correction in 8\% and 12\% of cases,
              respectively. In unit C, in tracheostomies without pretracheal
              tissue dissection, bronchoscopy was used to guide needle
              insertion; needle position required correction in 66\% of cases.
              Median duration of operations performed by thoracic surgeons and
              residents was 10 (range, 3--37) min and by intensive care doctors
              and residents was 16.5 (range, 3--63) min (p < 0.001). Time from
              the beginning of preparations for tracheostomy until the end of
              the whole procedure was median 32 min for bedside tracheostomies
              and 64 min for operations in the operating theatre (p < 0.001).
              Conclusion: Limited pretracheal tissue dissection enabled proper
              guiding needle insertion and bronchoscopy was rarely needed.
              Percutaneous tracheostomies performed by thoracic surgeons took
              less time, and duration of the whole procedure was remarkably

              of the most frequent procedures performed in the intensive care
              unit (ICU). PDT may add potential benefit to clinical management
              of critically ill patients. Despite this, no clinical guidelines
              are available. We sought to characterize current practice in this
              international survey. Methods An international survey, endorsed
              and peer reviewed by European Society of Intensive Care Medicine
              (ESICM), was carried out from May to October 2013. The
              questionnaire was accessible from the ESICM website in the
              `survey of the month' section. Results 429 physicians from 59
              countries responded to this survey. Single step dilatational
              tracheostomy was the most used PDT in ICU. Almost 75 \% of PDT's
              were performed by intensive care physicians. The main indication
              for PDT was prolonged mechanical ventilation. Tracheostomies were
              most frequently performed between 7--15 days after ICU admission.
              Volume control mechanical ventilation, and a combination of
              sedation, analgesia, neuromuscular blocking agents and fiberoptic
              bronchoscopy were used. Surgical tracheostomy was mainly
              performed in ICU by ENT specialists, and was generally chosen
              when for patients at increased risk for difficult PDT insertion.
              Bleeding controlled by compression and stoma
              infection/inflammation were the most common intra-procedural and
              late complications, respectively. Informed consent for PDT was
              obtained in only 60 \% of cases. Conclusions This first
              international picture of current practices in regard to
              tracheostomy insertion demonstrates considerable geographic
              variation in practice, suggesting a need for greater
              standardization of approaches to tracheostomy insertion.

              technique commonly used to resist regurgitation of gastric
              contents and protect the airway. A modification of this technique
              is implemented in certain clinical circumstances. However, there
              is currently no standard definition for a ``modified RSII.''
              Therefore, we surveyed clinicians at academic centers across the
              United States to establish a working definition of a ``modified
              RSII'' as well as the clinical scenarios in which it is being
              used. Methods A survey was created that queried the use and
              definition of modified RSII, and validated with test respondents.
              We then mailed the survey to all 131 anesthesia residency
              training programs across the United States. Logistic regression
              models were created to estimate the percentage of affirmative
              responses among respondents that performed modified RSII
              procedures and answered survey items in a consistent manner.
              Similar quantities were calculated by physician status (resident
              and attending). Results Four hundred ninety surveys were received
              from 58 institutions (44\% institution response rate), 93\% of
              respondents reported using a modified RSII, and of those 85\%
              consistently completed the survey instrument. A majority of
              respondents (71\%, CI: 63--77\%) reported administering oxygen
              before anesthesia induction, applying cricoid pressure, and
              attempting to ventilate the lungs via a facemask before securing
              the airway. Respondents noted that they would use a modified RSII
              procedure if the patient were either moderately or morbidly obese
              (each ~59\%, 53--64\%), had a history but no current symptoms of
              gastroesophageal reflux disease (52\%, 46--57\%), had a hiatal
              hernia (42\%, 36--48\%) or were a trauma patient who had been NPO
              for at least 8 hours (39\%, 33--45\%). Similar RSII results were
              obtained when repeating the analysis on the subset that did not
              enforce the consistency requirements. Conclusions Based on our
              survey we have established three defining features of a modified
              RSII: (1) oxygen administration before induction; (2) the use of
              cricoid pressure; and (3) an attempt to ventilate the patient's
              lungs before securing the airway. Although this definition seems
              intuitively obvious, no previous work has tested whether it is
              commonly accepted.",

              respirology manpower and ascertain the utilization of invasive
              diagnostic and therapeutic procedures (interventional
              pulmonology), a mail survey of all Canadian respirologists was
              conducted. The questionnaires were completed by 62\% (n=355) of
              573 possible participants. Of the respirologists who responded,
              69.2\% were younger than 50 years of age, 70.3\% had been in
              practice for fewer than 20 years, 64.4\% were in full- or
              part-time academic practice, and 72.9\% were based in urban
              centres with a catchment population of more than 250,000. The
              current ratio of respirologists to population in Canada, assuming
              a total population of 31,000,000, is 1:54,101. In the present
              survey, only 68.3\% respirologists practised clinical respirology
              for 50\% or more of their time, and half (49.5\%) of
              respirologists devoted more than 50\% of their time on
              nonrespirology or nonclinical activities. Thus, the more precise
              respirologist to population ratio appears to be 1:81,000. The
              current ratio meets the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons
              of Canada recommendations, and the current training programs meet
              present manpower requirements. With respect to the procedures
              performed, most specialists carried out bedside procedures and
              flexible bronchoscopy; a much smaller number did invasive
              procedures such as rigid bronchoscopy (20.8\%), transbronchial
              needle biopsy of lung (43\%), transbronchial biopsy of
              mediastinal lymph nodes (38\%), therapeutic bronchoscopy using
              laser, cryotherapy and stents (8.7\%), transthoracic needle
              biopsy (22.2\%) and thoracoscopy (11.3\%). Because 97\% of
              pulmonary specialists would like to perform invasive procedures,

              78\% (4,513/5,768; 95\% CI 77\% to 79\%) of initial attempts: it
              resulted in 85\% (3,843/4,513; 95\% CI 84\% to 86\%) success on

              an email survey was sent to every member of The Thoracic Society
              of Australia and New Zealand who was a doctor. RESULTS: Responses
              were received from 258 of 824 doctors. Australia and New Zealand
              was the location of training for 91\% and the United Kingdom for
              9\%. United Kingdom-trained doctors are more likely to conduct
              bronchoscopy from the patient's side rather than from behind. The
              services of anesthetists are utilized by 81\% of private
              bronchoscopists compared with 38\% of public ones. Two sedatives
              are used by 94\% of bronchoscopists, 96\% of whom use midazolam
              and fentanyl and 4\% use midazolam and propofol. When anesthesia
              is provided by anesthetists, 77\% use 2 agents, of which 53\% use
              midazolam and fentanyl and 37\% use midazolam and propofol. Those
              who work publicly conduct more procedures and are younger. For
              patients with heart valve defects, 39\% prescribe prophylactic
              antibiotics and 16\% do not cease clopidogrel where biopsy is
              anticipated. In 2013, pneumothoraces complicated 0.22\% of

              practices both generally and between different groups of
              bronchoscopists, yet it is a safe procedure. An important finding
              was the significantly high utilization of the services of

              performance and specific yield when adjusted for location of
              lesions, target size, and diagnosis. We present a
              multi-institutional prospective-outcomes database to assess
              diagnostic yields of advanced bronchoscopic procedures, as well
              as related morbidity and mortality. METHODS: Data were extracted
              and reviewed from an ongoing, paper-based, prospective,
              multi-institutional outcomes database for advanced diagnostic
              bronchoscopic procedures. All consecutive eligible patients are
              entered into this database, and information on demographics,
              procedure, and lesion characteristics as well as complications
              were documented. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed.
              RESULTS: A total of 310 diagnostic procedures were performed over
              a 1-year period in four institutions by 15 different clinicians.
              The majority of the patients were white (66\%), male (56\%),
              former smokers (55\%), with a mean age of 61 +/- 14 years. The
              average procedure time was 36 min, and the most common procedure
              was transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) (n = 198). Nodal
              tissue was obtained in 82.3\% from TBNA sampling with a mean of
              three passes using endobronchial ultrasound guidance with a
              22-gauge needle and mostly without on-site cytology. The overall
              diagnostic yield for all procedures was 75\%. There were few
              complications, and none required a change in disposition.
              CONCLUSIONS: Prospective and ongoing data analysis for
              bronchoscopic procedures is feasible and valuable.
              Lesion-adjusted diagnostic yields can be documented and
              potentially used for comparative assessment of different

              Descriptive survey. SETTING: Sixty-four acute care hospitals in
              the northeastern United States. SAMPLE: Responders represented 93
              critical care units: 59 adult and 34 pediatric units.
              MEASUREMENTS: Subjects completed a survey questionnaire. RESULTS:
              Forty-one percent reported cuffs were routinely deflated, with
              most (88\%) reporting cuff deflation every 8 to 12 hours or
              daily. In the pediatric population, minimal occlusive volume was
              the most frequent technique (29\%); whereas in the adult
              population, both minimal occlusive volume technique and minimal
              leak technique were used more frequently (36\%). Most (93\%) cuff
              pressures were measured every 8 to 12 hours or daily with a
              recommended maximum range of 20 to 30 mm Hg. Cuff deflation and
              cuff inflation were performed more often by the nursing staff
              (36\%). Cuff pressures were performed more often by respiratory
              staff (71\%). There were no statistically significant differences
              in the cuff management practices between the adult and pediatric
              populations. In comparing the results for adults to the data of
              1984 and 1987, most cuff management practices changed from every
              8 hours or less to every 8 to 12 hours or daily, and the nursing
              responsibility for these techniques increased (22\%). CONCLUSION:
              Most responders do not routinely deflate cuffs. Cuff management
              practices are performed less frequently, and nursing
              responsibility for these techniques has increased.",

              the output of a survey involving a cohort of all Italian
              hospitals performing thoracic surgery to gather data on
              anesthetic management, one-lung ventilation (OLV) management, and
              post-thoracotomy pain relief in thoracic anesthesia. DESIGN:
              Survey. SETTING: Italy. PARTICIPANTS: An invitation to
              participate in the survey was e-mailed to all the members of the
              Italian Society of Anesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine.
              INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 62
              responses were received from 47 centers. The key findings were:
              Double-lumen tube is still the first choice lung separation
              technique in current use; pressure-controlled ventilation and
              volume-controlled ventilation modes are homogenously distributed
              across the sample and, a tidal volumes (VT) of 4-6 mL/kg during
              OLV was preferred to all others; moderate or restrictive fluid
              management were the most used strategies of fluid administration
              in thoracic anesthesia; thoracic epidural analgesia represented
              the ``gold standard'' for post-thoracotomy pain relief in
              combination with intravenous analgesia. CONCLUSION: The results
              of this survey showed that Italian anesthesiologist follow the

              ventilation is associated with a lower incidence of pulmonary
              complications. However, there are few published data on routine
              pulmonary management in adult cardiac surgery. The present
              study's primary objective was to survey pulmonary management in
              this high-risk population, as practiced by anesthesiologists in
              France., All 460 registered France-based cardiac
              anesthesiologists were invited (by e-mail) to participate in an
              online survey in January--February 2015. The survey's
              questionnaire was designed to assess current practice in pre-,
              per-, and postoperative pulmonary management., In all, 198
              anesthesiologists (43\% of those invited) participated in the
              survey. Other than during the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) per
              se, 179 anesthesiologists (91\% of respondees) [95\% confidence
              interval (CI): 87--95] used a low-tidal-volume approach (6--8
              mL/kg), whereas techniques based on positive end-expiratory
              pressure and recruitment maneuvers vary greatly from 1
              anesthesiologist to another. During CPB, 104 (53\%) [95\% CI:
              46--60] anesthesiologists withdrew mechanical ventilation (with
              disconnection, in some cases) and 97 (49\%) [95\% CI: 42--56] did
              not prescribe positive end-expiratory pressure. One hundred
              sixty-five (83\%) [95\% CI: 78--88] anesthesiologists stated that
              a written protocol for peroperative pulmonary management was not
              available. Twenty (10\%) [95\% CI: 6--14] and 11 (5\%) [95\% CI:
              2--8] anesthesiologists stated that they did use protocols for
              ventilator use and recruitment maneuvers, respectively. The
              preoperative period (pulmonary examinations and prescription of
              additional assessments) and the postoperative period (extubation,
              and noninvasive ventilation) periods vary greatly from 1
              anesthesiologist to another., The great majority of French
              cardiac anesthesiologists use a low tidal volume during cardiac
              surgery (other than during CPB per se). However, pulmonary
              management procedures varied markedly from 1 anesthesiologist to
              another. There is a clear need for large clinical studies
              designed to identify best practice in pulmonary management.",

              of lung isolation techniques, and use of i.v. fluids. Results:
              Volume-controlled ventilation was favored over

              endobronchial tubes (DLETT) and bronchial blockers (BBs) with the
              pediatric fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) is the most preferred
              practice worldwide. Most centers possess standard adult FOBs,
              some, particularly in developing countries might not have access
              to the pediatric-sized devices. We have evaluated the role of
              preintubation airway assessment using the former, measuring the
              distance from the incisors to the carina and from carina to the
              left and right upper lobe bronchus in deciding the depth of
              insertion of the lung isolation device. Methods: The study was a
              randomized, controlled, double-blind trial consisting of 84
              patients (all >18 years) undergoing thoracic surgery over a
              12-month period. In the study group (n = 38), measurements
              obtained during FOB with the adult bronchoscope decided the depth
              of insertion of the lung isolation device. In the control group
              (n = 46), DLETTs and BBs were placed blindly followed by clinical
              confirmation by auscultation. Selection of the type and size of
              the lung isolation device was at the discretion of the
              anesthesiologist conducting the case. In all cases, pediatric FOB
              was used to confirm accurate placement of devices. Results: Of 84
              patients (DLETT used in 76 patients; BB used in 8 patients),
              preintubation airway measurements significantly improved the
              success rate of optimal placement of lung isolation device from
              25\% (11/44) to 50\% (18/36) (P = 0.04). Our incidence of failed
              device placement at initial insertion was 4.7\% (4/84). Incidence
              of malposition was 10\% (8/80) with 4 cases in each group. The
              incidence of suboptimal placement was lower in the study group at
              38.9\% (14/36) versus 65.9\% (29/44). Conclusions: Preintubation
              airway measurements with the adult FOB reduces airway

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Tracheostomy formation is one of the most commonly
              performed surgical procedures in critically ill intensive care
              participants requiring long-term mechanical ventilation. Both
              surgical tracheostomies (STs) and percutaneous tracheostomies
              (PTs) are used in current surgical practice; but until now, the
              optimal method of performing tracheostomies in critically ill
              participants remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the
              effectiveness and safety of percutaneous techniques compared to
              surgical techniques commonly used for elective tracheostomy in
              critically ill participants (adults and children) to assess
              whether there was a difference in complication rates between the
              procedures. We also assessed whether the effect varied between
              different groups of participants or settings (intensive care unit
              (ICU), operating room), different levels of operator experience,
              different percutaneous techniques, or whether the percutaneous
              techniques were carried out with or without bronchoscopic
              guidance. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following electronic
              databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL to 28 May 2015.
              We also searched reference lists of articles, 'grey literature',
              and dissertations. We handsearched intensive care and anaesthesia
              journals, abstracts, and proceedings of scientific meetings. We
              attempted to identify unpublished or ongoing studies by
              contacting manufacturers and experts in the field, and searching
              in trial registers. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized
              and quasi-randomized controlled trials (quasi-RCTs) comparing
              percutaneous techniques (experimental intervention) with surgical
              techniques (control intervention) used for elective tracheostomy
              in critically ill participants (adults and children). DATA
              COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three authors independently checked
              eligibility and extracted data on methodological quality,
              participant characteristics, intervention details, settings, and
              outcomes of interest using a standardized form. We then entered
              data into Review Manager 5, with a double-entry procedure. MAIN
              RESULTS: Of 785 identified citations, 20 trials from 1990 to 2011
              enrolling 1652 participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria. We
              judged most of the trials to be at low or unclear risk of bias
              across the six domains, and we judged four studies to have
              elements of high risk of bias; we did not classify any studies at
              overall low risk of bias. The quality of evidence was low for
              five of the seven outcomes (very low N = 1, moderate N = 1) and
              there was heterogeneity among the studies. There was a variety of
              adult participants and the procedures were performed by a wide
              range of differently experienced operators in different
              situations.There was no evidence of a difference in the rate of
              the primary outcomes: mortality directly related to the procedure
              (Peto odds ratio (POR) 0.52, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.10
              to 2.60, I² = 44\%, P = 0.42, 4 studies, 257 participants, low
              quality evidence); and serious, life-threatening adverse events -
              intraoperatively: risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95\% CI 0.57 to 1.53, I²
              = 27\%, P = 0.78, 12 studies, 1211 participants, low quality
              evidence,and direct postoperatively: RR 0.72, 95\% CI 0.41 to
              1.25, I² = 24\%, P = 0.24, 10 studies, 984 participants, low
              quality evidence.PTs significantly reduce the rate of the
              secondary outcome, wound infection/stomatitis by 76\% (RR 0.24,
              95\% CI 0.15 to 0.37, I² = 0\%, P < 0.00001, 12 studies, 936
              participants, moderate quality evidence) and the rate of
              unfavourable scarring by 75\% (RR 0.25, 95\% CI 0.07 to 0.91, I²
              = 86\%, P = 0.04, 6 studies, 789 participants, low quality
              evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in the rate of
              the secondary outcomes, major bleeding (RR 0.70, 95\% CI 0.45 to
              1.09, I² = 47\%, P = 0.12, 10 studies, 984 participants, very low
              quality evidence) and tracheostomy tube occlusion/obstruction,
              accidental decannulation, difficult tube change (RR 1.36, 95\% CI
              0.65 to 2.82, I² = 22\%, P = 0.42, 6 studies, 538 participants,
              low quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: When compared to
              STs, PTs significantly reduce the rate of wound
              infection/stomatitis (moderate quality evidence) and the rate of
              unfavourable scarring (low quality evidence due to imprecision
              and heterogeneity). In terms of mortality and the rate of serious
              adverse events, there was low quality evidence that
              non-significant positive effects exist for PTs. In terms of the
              rate of major bleeding, there was very low quality evidence that
              non-significant positive effects exist for PTs.However, because
              several groups of participants were excluded from the included
              studies, the number of participants in the included studies was
              limited, long-term outcomes were not evaluated, and data on
              participant-relevant outcomes were either sparse or not available
              for each study, the results of this meta-analysis are limited and
              cannot be applied to all critically ill adults.",

              coagulopathy. The following parameters were recorded
              preoperatively: age, sex, diagnosis, American Society of
              Anesthesia (ASA) class, body mass index (BMI), and number of days
              intubated. Recorded hematologic parameters included hemoglobin
              (Hgb), platelets, prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin
              time (PTT), and the international normalized ratio (INR) since it
              became available in 1998. All patients were ventilated on 100\%
              oxygen and vital signs were continuously monitored. Tracheotomy
              was carried out under continuous endoscopic guidance using a
              series of graduated dilators in the first 191 cases, and a
              single, tapered dilator in the remaining 309 patients. The
              preoperative data on each patient, along with the type of dilator
              used, the size of the tube, the intraoperative and postoperative
              complications, and blood loss information were recorded
              prospectively and maintained in a computer spreadsheet.
              Univariate analyses were used in each group separately for each
              type of dilator to assess the risks of a complication within
              subgroups defined by each parameter/characteristic, and the
              statistical significance assessed with a $\chi$2 test, or Fisher
              exact test. Results: The total complication rate was 9.2\%
              (13.6\% in the multiple dilator group, and 6.5\% in the single
              dilator group), with more than half of these considered minor.
              Overall, the two most common complications were oxygen
              desaturation in 14 cases and bleeding in 12 cases. The absence of
              serious complications such as pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum
              are attributable to the use of bronchoscopy. There was no
              significant association between the rate of complications and
              age, gender, ASA, weeks intubated, tracheostomy tube size, Hgb
              levels, platelets, PT, PTT, or INR. There was a statistically
              significant relationship between experience and the likelihood of
              complications in the multiple dilator group (P < .0001), with a
              higher rate of complications in the first 30 patients (40\%)
              compared with 8.7\% in the remaining 161 patients. This
              relationship did not exist for the first 30 patients in the
              single dilator group. Patients with a BMI of 30 or higher
              experienced a significantly greater (P < .05) number of
              complications (15\%), compared with an 8\% complication rate in
              patients with a BMI of less than 30. This risk was even more
              significant for patients with a BMI of 30 or greater who were
              also in ASA class 4 (11/56 or 20\%) (P < .02). Conclusions:
              Endoscopic PDT is associated with a low complication rate and is
              at least as safe as surgical tracheotomy in the ICU setting.
              Bronchoscopy significantly decreases the incidence of
              complications and should be used routinely. While embraced by
              critical care physicians, endoscopic PDT has been infrequently
              performed by otolaryngologists. As the airway experts,
              otolaryngologists are in the best position to learn and teach the
              procedure as it should be done.",

              estimates of tracheostomy use and outcomes from the National
              Inpatient Sample from 1993 to 2012. We used hierarchical models
              to determine factors associated with tracheostomy use among MV
              patients., Measurements and Main Results: We identified 1,352,432
              adults who received tracheostomy from 1993 to 2012 (9.1\% of MV
              patients). Tracheostomy was more common in surgical patients,
              men, and racial/ethnic minorities. Age-adjusted incidence of
              tracheostomy increased by 106\%, rising disproportionately to MV
              use. Among MV patients, tracheostomy rose from 6.9\% in 1993 to
              9.8\% in 2008, and then it declined to 8.7\% in 2012 (P <
              0.0001). Increases in tracheostomy use were driven by surgical
              patients (9.5\% in 1993; 15.0\% in 2012; P < 0.0001), with little
              change among nonsurgical patients (5.8\% in 1993; 5.9\% in 2012;
              P < 0.0001). Over time, tracheostomies were performed earlier
              (median, 11 d in 1998; 10 d in 2012; P < 0.0001), whereas
              hospital length of stay declined (median, 39 d in 1993; 26 d in
              2012; P < 0.0001), discharges to long-term facilities increased
              (40.1\% vs. 71.9\%; P < 0.0001), and hospital mortality declined
              (38.1\% vs. 14.7\%; P < 0.0001)., Conclusions: Over the past two

              increase in discharge of tracheostomy patients to long-term care

              the coronary circulation, these occlusions are often long and

              most common method, and cryoballoon ablation is the second most
              frequently used technology. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter,
              randomized trial to determine whether cryoballoon ablation was
              noninferior to radiofrequency ablation in symptomatic patients
              with drug-refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The primary
              efficacy end point in a time-to-event analysis was the first
              documented clinical failure (recurrence of atrial fibrillation,
              occurrence of atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia, use of
              antiarrhythmic drugs, or repeat ablation) following a 90-day
              period after the index ablation. The noninferiority margin was
              prespecified as a hazard ratio of 1.43. The primary safety end
              point was a composite of death, cerebrovascular events, or
              serious treatment-related adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 762
              patients underwent randomization (378 assigned to cryoballoon
              ablation and 384 assigned to radiofrequency ablation). The mean
              duration of follow-up was 1.5 years. The primary efficacy end
              point occurred in 138 patients in the cryoballoon group and in
              143 in the radiofrequency group (1-year Kaplan-Meier event rate
              estimates, 34.6\% and 35.9\%, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.96;
              95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.76 to 1.22; P<0.001 for
              noninferiority). The primary safety end point occurred in 40
              patients in the cryoballoon group and in 51 patients in the
              radiofrequency group (1-year Kaplan-Meier event rate estimates,
              10.2\% and 12.8\%, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.78; 95\% CI,
              0.52 to 1.18; P=0.24). CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized trial,

              interacted with on 2D screens limiting their usefulness. A
              digital computer-generated real-time holographic display of
              patient's 3D data could provide a spatially accurate image with
              all the depth cues and afford interaction within the image.
              METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a feasibility study of creating
              real-time interactive 3D digital holograms with a purpose-built
              prototype using intraprocedural data from 3D rotational
              angiography and live 3D transesophageal echocardiography. The
              primary objective was to demonstrate that all the anatomical
              landmarks identified on standard imaging can be similarly
              identified using dynamic and static holographic images. The
              secondary objective was to demonstrate the usability of
              interactions with the image. Parameters were assessed by a rating
              scale. Eight patients were enrolled of whom five underwent
              transcatheter ASD closure using 3DTEE and three patients were
              evaluated by 3D rotational angiography. In all cases dynamic
              real-time and static 3D holograms were created in standard cath
              lab conditions. Four individual observers identified all
              anatomical landmarks on the holographic display independently

              marking, cropping and rotation were performed. There were no

              standard clinical setting with real patient volumetric data. The

  abstract = "Medical imaging plays a critical role in cancer diagnosis and
              planning. Many of these patients rely on surgical intervention
              for curative outcomes. This requires a careful identification of
              the primary and microscopic tumors, and the complete removal of
              cancer. Although there have been efforts to adapt
              traditional-imaging modalities for intraoperative image guidance,
              they suffer from several constraints such as large hardware
              footprint, high-operation cost, and disruption of the surgical
              workflow. Because of the ease of image acquisition, relatively
              low-cost devices and intuitive operation, optical imaging methods
              have received tremendous interests for use in real-time
              image-guided surgery. To improve imaging depth under low
              interference by tissue autofluorescence, many of these
              applications utilize light in the near-infrared (NIR)
              wavelengths, which is invisible to human eyes. With the
              availability of a wide selection of tumor-avid contrast agents,
              advancements in imaging sensors, electronic and optical designs,
              surgeons are able to combine different attributes of NIR optical
              imaging techniques to improve treatment outcomes. The emergence
              of diverse commercial and experimental image guidance systems,
              which are in various stages of clinical translation, attests to
              the potential high impact of intraoperative optical imaging
              methods to improve speed of oncologic surgery with high accuracy

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Flexible bronchoscopy is a fundamental procedure in
              anesthesia and critical care medicine. Learning this procedure is
              a complex task, but the use of simulation-based training provides
              significant advantages like enhanced patient safety. Access to
              bronchoscopy simulators may be limited in low resources settings.
              We developed a low-cost 3D printed bronchoscopy training model.
              METHODS: A parametric airway model was obtained from an online
              medical model repository and fabricated using a low-cost 3D
              printer. Participating physicians had no prior bronchoscopy
              experience. Participants received a 30-minute lecture on flexible
              bronchoscopy and were administered a 15-item pre-test
              questionnaire on bronchoscopy. After, participants were
              instructed to perform a series of predetermined bronchoscopy
              tasks on the 3D printed simulator on 4 consecutive occasions.
              Time to perform the tasks and the quality of the performance
              (identification of bronchial anatomy, technique, dexterity, lack
              of trauma) were recorded. Upon completion of the simulator tests,
              participants were administered the 15 items questionnaire
              (post-test) again. Participant satisfaction data on perceived
              usefulness and accuracy of the 3D model were collected.
              Statistical analysis was performed using t-test. Data are
              reported as mean ($\pm$ standard deviation). RESULTS: Time to
              complete all tasks was 152.9 ($\pm$ 71.5) sec on the 1st attempt
              vs 98.7 ($\pm$ 40.3) sec on the 4th attempt (p=0.03). Likewise,
              quality of performance score improved from 8.3 ($\pm$ 6.7) to
              18.2 ($\pm$ 2.5) (p<0.0001). Average number of correct answers to
              the questionnaire was 6.8 ($\pm$ 1.9) in the pre-test and 13.3
              ($\pm$ 3.1) in the post-test (p<0.0001). Participants reported
              high satisfaction with the perceived usefulness and accuracy of
              the model. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a 3D printed model for
              bronchoscopy training. This model improved trainee performance,
              and may represent a valid, low-cost bronchoscopy training tool.",

              present analyses concern its primary tumor (T) component.
              METHODS: From 1999 to 2010, 77,156 evaluable patients, 70,967
              with non-small-cell lung cancer, were collected; and 33,115 had
              either a clinical or a pathological classification, known tumor
              size, sufficient T information, and no metastases. Survival was
              measured from date of diagnosis or surgery for clinically and
              pathologically staged tumors. Tumor-size cutpoints were evaluated
              by the running log-rank statistics. T descriptors were evaluated
              in a multivariate Cox regression analysis adjusted for age,
              gender, histological type, and geographic region. RESULTS: The
              3-cm cutpoint significantly separates T1 from T2. From 1 to 5 cm,
              each centimeter separates tumors of significantly different
              prognosis. Prognosis of tumors greater than 5 cm but less than or
              equal to 7 cm is equivalent to T3, and that of those greater than
              7 cm to T4. Bronchial involvement less than 2 cm from carina, but
              without involving it, and total atelectasis/pneumonitis have a T2
              prognosis. Involvement of the diaphragm has a T4 prognosis.
              Invasion of the mediastinal pleura is a descriptor seldom used.
              CONCLUSIONS: Recommended changes are as follows: to subclassify

              $\leq$3 cm); to subclassify T2 into T2a (>3 to $\leq$4 cm) and
              T2b (>4 to $\leq$5 cm); to reclassify tumors greater than 5 to
              less than or equal to 7 cm as T3; to reclassify tumors greater
              than 7 cm as T4; to group involvement of main bronchus as T2

              significant clinical burden for patients and relevant economic
              impact. Limited evidence exists on the management costs of NSCLC
              patients, especially in the late phases of the disease. The main
              objective of this analysis was to evaluate the economic impact of
              clinical management of NSCLC patients in the Italian population.
              METHODS: This evaluation was an economic analysis of the
              observational and multicentre study LIFE, which described the
              therapeutic approach in routine clinical practice for NSCLC
              patients, progressing after first-line treatment. This study
              evaluated resource consumption in different Italian hospitals,
              including specialist visits, hospitalizations, accesses to first
              aid, pharmacological treatment, laboratory tests and palliative
              care. The National Healthcare Service perspective was adopted.
              RESULTS: In this study, N = 191 patients enrolled in the LIFE
              study were included. Patients were aged 64.2 years and were
              predominantly males (66\%). In the different line of treatments,
              monthly costs of patients ranged between €1471 (first line) and
              €1788 (third line). The overall healthcare cost over the average
              period of observation (16.4 months) was €25,859 per patient.
              Overall, oncology therapy was the cost driver, although the
              composition of medical costs changed across the different lines
              of treatment, with costs for concomitant medication and

              mortality of lung cancer, a growing number of lung cancer
              patients and their families are faced with a tremendous economic
              burden because of the high cost of treatment in China. This study
              was conducted to estimate the economic burden and patient
              responsibility of lung cancer patients and the impact of this
              burden on family income. METHODS: This study uses data from a
              retrospective questionnaire survey conducted in 10 communities in
              urban China and includes 195 surviving lung cancer patients
              diagnosed over the previous five years. The calculation of direct
              economic burden included both direct medical and direct
              nonmedical costs. Indirect costs were calculated using the human
              capital approach, which measures the productivity lost for both
              patients and family caregivers. The price index was applied for
              the cost calculation. RESULTS: The average economic burden from
              lung cancer was $43,336 per patient, of which the direct cost per
              capita was $42,540 (98.16\%) and the indirect cost per capita was
              $795 (1.84\%). Of the total direct medical costs, 35.66\% was
              paid by the insurer and 9.84\% was not covered by insurance. The
              economic burden for diagnosed lung cancer patients in the first
              year following diagnosis was $30,277 per capita, which accounted
              for 171\% of the household annual income, a percentage that fell
              to 107\% after subtracting the compensation from medical
              insurance. CONCLUSIONS: The economic burden for lung cancer

              indicate that computed tomography (CT) lung cancer screening for
              current and former smokers with three annual screens can be
              cost-effective in a trial setting. However, the
              cost-effectiveness in a population-based setting with >3
              screening rounds is uncertain. Therefore, the objective of this
              study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of lung cancer
              screening in a population-based setting in Ontario, Canada, and
              evaluate the effects of screening eligibility criteria. METHODS
              AND FINDINGS: This study used microsimulation modeling informed
              by various data sources, including the Ontario Health Insurance
              Plan (OHIP), Ontario Cancer Registry, smoking behavior surveys,
              and the NLST. Persons, born between 1940 and 1969, were examined
              from a third-party health care payer perspective across a
              lifetime horizon. Starting in 2015, 576 CT screening scenarios
              were examined, varying by age to start and end screening, smoking
              eligibility criteria, and screening interval. Among the examined
              outcome measures were lung cancer deaths averted, life-years
              gained, percentage ever screened, costs (in 2015 Canadian
              dollars), and overdiagnosis. The results of the base-case
              analysis indicated that annual screening was more cost-effective
              than biennial screening. Scenarios with eligibility criteria that
              required as few as 20 pack-years were dominated by scenarios that
              required higher numbers of accumulated pack-years. In general,
              scenarios that applied stringent smoking eligibility criteria
              (i.e., requiring higher levels of accumulated smoking exposure)
              were more cost-effective than scenarios with less stringent
              smoking eligibility criteria, with modest differences in
              life-years gained. Annual screening between ages 55-75 for
              persons who smoked $\geq$40 pack-years and who currently smoke or
              quit $\leq$10 y ago yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness
              ratio of $41,136 Canadian dollars ($33,825 in May 1, 2015, United
              States dollars) per life-year gained (compared to annual
              screening between ages 60-75 for persons who smoked $\geq$40
              pack-years and who currently smoke or quit $\leq$10 y ago), which
              was considered optimal at a cost-effectiveness threshold of
              $50,000 Canadian dollars ($41,114 May 1, 2015, US dollars). If
              50\% lower or higher attributable costs were assumed, the
              incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of this scenario was
              estimated to be $38,240 ($31,444 May 1, 2015, US dollars) or
              $48,525 ($39,901 May 1, 2015, US dollars), respectively. If 50\%
              lower or higher costs for CT examinations were assumed, the
              incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of this scenario was
              estimated to be $28,630 ($23,542 May 1, 2015, US dollars) or
              $73,507 ($60,443 May 1, 2015, US dollars), respectively. This
              scenario would screen 9.56\% (499,261 individuals) of the total
              population (ever- and never-smokers) at least once, which would
              require 4,788,523 CT examinations, and reduce lung cancer
              mortality in the total population by 9.05\% (preventing 13,108
              lung cancer deaths), while 12.53\% of screen-detected cancers
              would be overdiagnosed (4,282 overdiagnosed cases). Sensitivity
              analyses indicated that the overall results were most sensitive
              to variations in CT examination costs. Quality of life was not
              incorporated in the analyses, and assumptions for follow-up
              procedures were based on data from the NLST, which may not be
              generalizable to a population-based setting. CONCLUSIONS: Lung

              of constrained medical resources, the cost-effectiveness of such
              a program needs to be demonstrated. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this
              study was to systematically review the literature analyzing the
              cost-effectiveness of lung cancer screening using LDCT. METHODS:
              We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBM Reviews-Health Technology
              Assessment, the National Health Service Economic Evaluation
              Database (NHS-EED), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic
              Reviews. Due to technological progress in CT, we limited our
              search to studies published between January 2000 and December
              2014. Our search returned 393 unique results. After removing
              studies that did not meet our inclusion criteria, 13 studies
              remained. Costs are presented in 2014 US dollars (US\$). RESULTS:
              The results from the economic evaluations identified in this
              review were varied. All identified studies reported outcomes
              using either additional survival (life-years gained) or
              quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs gained). Results ranged from
              US\$18,452 to US\$66,480 per LYG and US\$27,756 to US\$243,077
              per QALY gained for repeated screening. The results of
              cost-effectiveness analyses were sensitive to several key model
              parameters, including the prevalence of lung cancer, cost of LDCT
              for screening, the proportion of lung cancer detected as
              localized disease, lead time bias, and, if included, the
              characteristics of a smoking cessation program. CONCLUSIONS: The
              cost-effectiveness of a lung cancer screening program using LDCT
              remains to be conclusively resolved. It is expected that its
              cost-effectiveness will largely depend on identifying an
              appropriate group of high-risk subjects.",

              behavior, and substance abuse. In an effort to elucidate the
              neurobiological underpinnings of impulsive aggression and to help
              account for its connections with these other disorders, this
              paper reviews relevant biochemical, brain imaging, and genetic

              between serotonin and dopamine systems in the prefrontal cortex
              may be an important mechanism underlying the link between
              impulsive aggression and its comorbid disorders. Specifically,
              serotonin hypofunction may represent a biochemical trait that
              predisposes individuals to impulsive aggression, with dopamine
              hyperfunction contributing in an additive fashion to the
              serotonergic deficit. The current paper proposes a modified
              diathesis-stress model of impulsive aggression in which the
              underlying biological diathesis may be deficient serotonergic
              function in the ventral prefrontal cortex. This underlying

              aggression towards oneself and others, and as depression under

              impulsive aggression is understood in the context of dopamine
              dysregulation resulting from serotonergic deficiency. Also

              improving survival in individuals at high-risk of lung cancer.
              One potential facilitator to early diagnosis is low-dose computed

              effectiveness of LDCT in early diagnosis of lung cancer, as
              indicated by the findings from the National Lung Screening Trial

              screening (LCS) with low-dose computed tomography (CT) a public
              health recommendation in 2013. The Centers for Medicare and
              Medicaid Services (CMS) currently reimburse LCS for asymptomatic
              individuals aged 55-77 years who have a tobacco smoking history
              of at least 30 pack-years and who are either currently smoking or
              had quit less than 15 years earlier. Commercial insurers
              reimburse the cost of LCS for individuals aged 55-80 years with
              the same smoking history. Effective care for the millions of
              Americans who qualify for LCS requires an organized step-wise
              approach. The 10-pillar model reflects the elements required to
              support a successful LCS program: eligibility, education,
              examination ordering, image acquisition, image review,
              communication, referral network, quality improvement,

              the Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) from the

              probes, allow accurate central and peripheral pulmonary lesion
              localisation and biopsy while at the same time avoiding vascular
              structures. Increases in computational processing power allow
              three-dimensional reconstruction of computed tomographic raw data

              is imperative to understand how resources are used to diagnose
              and treat this disease. This paper describes a method of
              modelling the direct patient care costs for lung cancer from the
              perspective of the government as payer in a universal health care
              system. Clinical algorithms were developed to describe the
              management of non-small cell (NSCLC) and small cell (SCLC) lung
              cancer. Patients were allocated to the treatment algorithms in
              the model based on a knowledge of their distribution by cell type
              and stage in Canadian cases. A microsimulation model developed by
              Statistics Canada was used to integrate the data on type of lung
              cancer, extent of disease, clinical management, survival and
              health care resource utilization. The direct care costs for
              diagnosis and treatment of NSCLC ranged from \$Cdn 17 889 for the
              surgery/post-operative radiotherapy treatment of Stages I and II
              to \$Cdn 6333 for supportive care for patients with Stage IV
              disease. The costs of determining relapse for NSCLC were
              estimated to be \$Cdn 1528 and terminal care costs, made up
              largely of hospitalization charges and some palliative
              radiotherapy, were \$Cdn 10 331. Direct care costs for the
              diagnosis and initial treatment of SCLC ranged from \$Cdn 18 691
              for management of limited stage disease to \$Cdn 4739 for the
              supportive care of patients with extensive disease. The cost of
              determining relapse for SCLC was estimated to be \$Cdn 1590 and
              terminal care costs averaged \$Cdn 9966. For all 15 624 cases of
              lung cancer diagnosed in Canada in 1988, it was estimated that
              the total cost of providing treatment and follow-up, and managing
              relapse over 5 years was \$Cdn 328 million. Despite the large
              total cost of lung cancer management, estimates of cost
              effectiveness of therapy showed that the cost per life year
              gained was approximately \$Cdn 11 000 for NSCLC and \$Cdn 19 560
              for SCLC. These estimates of the direct health care costs assume
              that all patients have access to care, treatment is uncomplicated
              and practice is standard, and must be viewed as an idealized
              assessment of the cost of lung cancer management. The
              microsimulation model, however, does provide a useful framework
              for evaluating the costs of new diagnostic procedures, treatment

              been shown to reduce mortality from lung cancer; however, the
              optimal screening duration and ``at risk'' population are not
              known. METHODS: The Cancer Risk Management Model developed by
              Statistics Canada for the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer
              includes a lung screening module based on data from the U.S.
              National Lung Screening Trial (nlst). The base-case scenario
              reproduces nlst outcomes with high fidelity. The impact in Canada
              of annual screening on the number of incident cases and
              life-years gained, with a wider range of age and smoking history
              eligibility criteria and varied participation rates, was modelled
              to show the magnitude of clinical benefit nationally and by
              province. Life-years gained, costs (discounted and undiscounted),
              and resource requirements were also estimated. RESULTS: In 2014,
              1.4 million Canadians were eligible for screening according to
              nlst criteria. Over 10 years, screening would detect 12,500 more
              lung cancers than the expected 268,300 and would gain 9200
              life-years. The computed tomography imaging requirement of
              24,000-30,000 at program initiation would rise to between 87,000
              and 113,000 by the 5th year of an annual nlst-like screening
              program. Costs would increase from approximately \$75 million to
              \$128 million at 10 years, and the cumulative cost nationally
              over 10 years would approach \$1 billion, partially offset by a
              reduction in the costs of managing advanced lung cancer.
              CONCLUSIONS: Modelling various ways in which ldct might be

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Better integration between cancer care
              systems and primary care physicians (PCPs) is a goal of most
              healthcare systems, but little direction exists on how this can
              be achieved. This study systematically examined the extent of
              integration between PCPs and a regional cancer program (RCP) to
              identify opportunities for improvement. METHOD: Cross-sectional
              survey of all practising PCPs in the region of interest using a
              study-specific instrument based on a three-tier conceptualization
              of integration. RESULTS: Among the 473 PCPs who responded (63\%
              response rate), perceived role clarity and the desire for greater
              involvement in patient care varied across the care trajectory.
              Specific gaps were identified in PCPs' understanding of the
              referral process and patient follow-up after treatment.
              CONCLUSION: Our novel survey of PCPs explicated the strategies
              that could improve their integration in cancer care, including
              mechanisms to support PCPs in the initial diagnosis of their
              patients and standardized post-treatment transition plans

  abstract = "Background Despite more than a decade of research on hospitalists
              and their performance, disagreement still exists regarding
              whether and how hospital-based physicians improve the quality of
              inpatient care delivery. This systematic review summarizes the
              findings from 65 comparative evaluations to determine whether
              hospitalists provide a higher quality of inpatient care relative
              to traditional inpatient physicians who maintain hospital
              privileges with concurrent outpatient practices. Methods Articles
              on hospitalist performance published between January 1996 and
              December 2010 were identified through MEDLINE, Embase, Science
              Citation Index, CINAHL, NHS Economic Evaluation Database and a
              hand-search of reference lists, key journals and editorials.
              Comparative evaluations presenting original, quantitative data on
              processes, efficiency or clinical outcome measures of care
              between hospitalists, community-based physicians and traditional
              academic attending physicians were included (n = 65). After
              proposing a conceptual framework for evaluating inpatient
              physician performance, major findings on quality are summarized
              according to their percentage change, direction and statistical
              significance. Results The majority of reviewed articles
              demonstrated that hospitalists are efficient providers of
              inpatient care on the basis of reductions in their patients'
              average length of stay (69\%) and total hospital costs (70\%);
              however, the clinical quality of hospitalist care appears to be
              comparable to that provided by their colleagues. The
              methodological quality of hospitalist evaluations remains a
              concern and has not improved over time. Persistent issues include
              insufficient reporting of source or sample populations (n = 30),
              patients lost to follow-up (n = 42) and estimates of effect or
              random variability (n = 35); inappropriate use of statistical
              tests (n = 55); and failure to adjust for established confounders
              (n = 37). Conclusions Future research should include an expanded
              focus on the specific structures of care that differentiate
              hospitalists from other inpatient physician groups as well as the
              development of better conceptual and statistical models that
              identify and measure underlying mechanisms driving
              provider-outcome associations in quality.",

              for understanding the effectiveness of Canada's cancer care
              system. Although 5-year relative survival for colorectal cancer
              and lung cancer has been previously reported, only recently has
              pan-Canadian relative survival by stage been analyzed using
              comprehensive registry data. This article presents a first look
              at 2-year relative survival by stage for colorectal and lung
              cancer across 9 provinces. As expected, 2-year age-standardized
              relative survival ratios (arsrs) for colorectal cancer and lung
              cancer were higher when the cancer was diagnosed at an earlier
              stage. The arsrs for stage i colorectal cancer ranged from 92.2\%
              in Nova Scotia [95\% confidence interval (ci): 88.6\% to 95.1\%]
              to 98.4\% in British Columbia (95\% ci: 96.2\% to 99.3\%); for
              stage iv, they ranged from 24.3\% in Prince Edward Island (95\%
              ci: 15.2\% to 34.4\%) to 38.8\% in New Brunswick (95\% ci: 33.3\%
              to 44.2\%). The arsrs for stage i lung cancer ranged from 66.5\%
              in Prince Edward Island (95\% ci: 54.5\% to 76.5\%) to 84.8\% in
              Ontario (95\% ci: 83.5\% to 86.0\%). By contrast, arsrs for stage

              The available stage data are too recent to allow for meaningful
              comparisons between provinces, but over time, analyzing relative
              survival by stage can provide further insight into the known
              differences in 5-year relative survival. As the data mature, they
              will enable an assessment of the extent to which interprovincial
              differences in relative survival are influenced by differences in
              stage distribution or treatment effectiveness (or both),

              in the current year and compiles the most recent data on cancer
              incidence, mortality, and survival. Incidence data were collected
              by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program; the
              National Program of Cancer Registries; and the North American
              Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data were
              collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2017,
              1,688,780 new cancer cases and 600,920 cancer deaths are
              projected to occur in the United States. For all sites combined,
              the cancer incidence rate is 20\% higher in men than in women,
              while the cancer death rate is 40\% higher. However, sex
              disparities vary by cancer type. For example, thyroid cancer
              incidence rates are 3-fold higher in women than in men (21 vs 7
              per 100,000 population), despite equivalent death rates (0.5 per
              100,000 population), largely reflecting sex differences in the
              ``epidemic of diagnosis.'' Over the past decade of available
              data, the overall cancer incidence rate (2004-2013) was stable in
              women and declined by approximately 2\% annually in men, while
              the cancer death rate (2005-2014) declined by about 1.5\%
              annually in both men and women. From 1991 to 2014, the overall
              cancer death rate dropped 25\%, translating to approximately
              2,143,200 fewer cancer deaths than would have been expected if
              death rates had remained at their peak. Although the cancer death
              rate was 15\% higher in blacks than in whites in 2014, increasing
              access to care as a result of the Patient Protection and
              Affordable Care Act may expedite the narrowing racial gap; from
              2010 to 2015, the proportion of blacks who were uninsured halved,

              be achieved using either a double-lumen tube (DLT) or a bronchial
              blocker (BB). Most thoracic anesthesiologists prefer the use of
              DLT. However, lung separation in patients with potential

              reflects changes in evidence since the previous guideline update.
              Fourteen randomized controlled trials provide the evidence base;
              earlier phase trials also informed recommendation development.
              Recommendations New or revised recommendations include the
              following. Regarding first-line treatment for patients with
              non-squamous cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma (without
              positive markers, eg, EGFR/ALK /ROS1), if the patient has high
              programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, pembrolizumab
              should be used alone; if the patient has low PD-L1 expression,
              clinicians should offer standard chemotherapy. All other clinical
              scenarios follow 2015 recommendations. Regarding second-line
              treatment in patients who received first-line chemotherapy,
              without prior immune checkpoint therapy, if NSCLC tumor is
              positive for PD-L1 expression, clinicians should use single-agent
              nivolumab, pembrolizumab, or atezolizumab; if tumor has negative
              or unknown PD-L1 expression, clinicians should use nivolumab or
              atezolizumab. All immune checkpoint therapy is recommended alone
              plus in the absence of contraindications. For patients who
              received a prior first-line immune checkpoint inhibitor,
              clinicians should offer standard chemotherapy. For patients who
              cannot receive immune checkpoint inhibitor after chemotherapy,
              docetaxel is recommended; in patients with nonsquamous NSCLC,
              pemetrexed is recommended. In patients with a sensitizing EGFR
              mutation, disease progression after first-line epidermal growth
              factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, and T790M
              mutation, osimertinib is recommended; if NSCLC lacks the T790M
              mutation, then chemotherapy is recommended. Patients with ROS1
              gene rearrangement without prior crizotinib may be offered
              crizotinib, or if they previously received crizotinib, they may

  abstract = "RATIONALE: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends
              lung cancer screening with low-dose chest computed tomographic
              scans (LDCT) for a well-defined high-risk population. Data on the
              frequency and impact of incidental findings (IFs) based on LDCT
              scans performed within a centralized lung cancer screening
              program have not been reported. OBJECTIVES: Researchers in
              previous studies have reported IFs in the setting of clinical
              trials. We present our findings in a real clinical setting where
              the decision to manage these findings may depend on factors that
              are not captured in a research trial such as disclosing IFs,
              patient preferences, severity of comorbidities, and physician
              expertise. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of
              participants in the Cleveland Clinic Lung Cancer Screening
              Program from April 1, 2015, to February 17, 2016. Lung Imaging
              Reporting and Data System categories and all reported findings
              were extracted from the structured radiology report. Downstream
              investigations that occurred as a result of the imaging findings
              were recorded. Medicare reimbursement rates were documented for
              all screening-related testing and treatment. RESULTS: A total of
              320 LDCT-screened patients' records were reviewed. The most
              commonly reported IFs were pulmonary (69.6\%), cardiovascular
              (67.5\%), and gastrointestinal (25.9\%). Fifteen percent of the
              scans had an IF that resulted in further evaluation. The majority
              of patients who underwent further testing had cardiovascular
              findings (10.3\%); less frequently, they had thyroid or adrenal
              nodules (2.1\%), hepatic lesions (0.9\%), renal masses (0.6\%),
              or pulmonary disease (0.6\%). The most frequently ordered
              investigations were echocardiography (n = 9), cardiac stress test
              (n = 9), and CT angiography (n = 6). Reimbursement for the
              screening process, evaluation, and treatment of
              screening-detected findings averaged \$817 per screened patient.
              CONCLUSIONS: Clinically significant IFs on LDCT scans for lung
              cancer screening are common, and their potential impact should be
              included in the shared decision-making process. Screening program
              staff should develop a standard approach for the evaluation of
              these findings and consider the financial impact when seeking
              infrastructure support for screening program implementation.",

              intraperitoneal mesh placement (LapIPOM) for minimally invasive
              incisional hernia repair. We aimed to compare LapIPOM with rIPOM
              in terms of hospital length of stay (LOS) and 30-day
              postoperative complications in patients undergoing incisional
              hernia repair within the Americas Hernia Society Quality
              Collaborative. STUDY DESIGN: Propensity score analysis was used
              to compare matched groups of patients within the Americas Hernia
              Society Quality Collaborative undergoing LapIPOM vs rIPOM. The
              primary outcomes measure was hospital LOS and secondary outcomes
              were 30-day wound events. RESULTS: Four hundred and fifty-four
              (71.9\%) patients underwent LapIPOM and 177 (28.1\%) underwent
              rIPOM. The laparoscopic group had an increased median LOS (1 vs 0
              days; interquartile range 3.00; p < 0.001). The risk of surgical
              site occurrence was higher in the LapIPOM group vs the rIPOM
              group (14\% vs 5\%; p = 0.001); however, surgical site occurrence
              requiring procedural intervention was similar between the groups
              (1\% vs 0\%; p = 1). Operative time longer than 2 hours was more
              common in the rIPOM group (47\% vs 31\%; p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS:
              Despite longer operative times using the rIPOM approach, patients

              Seventy-eight patients with histopathologically confirmed GISTs
              underwent preoperative CT. Texture analysis was performed on
              unenhanced and contrast-enhanced CT images, respectively.
              Fourteen CT texture parameters were obtained and compared among
              GISTs at different malignancy risks with one-way analysis of
              variance or independent-samples Kruskal-Wallis test. Correlations
              between CT texture parameters and malignancy risk were analysed
              with Spearman's correlation test. Diagnostic performance of CT
              texture parameters in differentiating GISTs at low/very low
              malignancy risk was tested with receiver operating characteristic
              (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: Three parameters on unenhanced images
              (r=-0.268-0.506), four parameters on arterial phase
              (r=-0.365-0.508), and six parameters on venous phase
              (r=-0.343-0.481) imaging correlated significantly with malignancy
              risk of GISTs, respectively (all p<0.05). For identifying GISTs
              at low/very low malignancy risk, three parameters on unenhanced
              images (area under ROC curve [AUC], 0.676-0.802), four parameters
              on arterial phase (AUC, 0.637-0.811), and six parameters on
              venous phase (AUC, 0.636-0.791) imaging showed significant
              diagnostic performance, respectively (all p<0.05), especially
              maximum frequency on both unenhanced and contrast-enhanced images
              (AUC, 0.791-0.811). CONCLUSION: Texture analysis of CT images
              holds great potential to predict the malignancy risk of GISTs

              perturbations to the jaw to quantify its stiffness in the
              mid-sagittal plane. Measured jaw stiffness was anisotropic.
              Stiffness was greatest along a protrusion-retraction axis and
              least in the direction of jaw raising and lowering. Consistent
              with the idea that speech movements reflect directional
              asymmetries in jaw stiffness, kinematic variability during speech
              production was found to be high in directions in which stiffness
              is low and vice versa. In addition, for higher jaw elevations,

               inpatient and outpatient care. The guidance is directed to all

               staff can have a profound effect on patient experience of care.
               As the guidance is generic in nature we have concentrated on
               core areas such as staff-patient interaction. There are

              programs performing bronchoscopy is quite variable. Some programs
              provide didactic lectures with hands-on supervision, other
              programs incorporate advanced simulation centers, whereas others
              have a checklist approach. Although no single method has been
              proven best, the variability alone suggests that outcomes are
              variable. Program directors and certifying bodies need guidance
              to create standards for training programs. Little well-developed
              literature on the topic exists. METHODS: To provide credible and
              trustworthy guidance, rigorous methodology has been applied to
              create this bronchoscopy consensus training statement. All
              panelists were vetted and approved by the CHEST Guidelines
              Oversight Committee. Each topic group drafted questions in a PICO
              (population, intervention, comparator, outcome) format. MEDLINE
              data through PubMed and the Cochrane Library were systematically
              searched. Manual searches also supplemented the searches. All
              gathered references were screened for consideration based on
              inclusion criteria, and all statements were designated as an
              Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement. RESULTS: We suggest that
              professional societies move from a volume-based certification
              system to skill acquisition and knowledge-based competency
              assessment for trainees. Bronchoscopy training programs should
              incorporate multiple tools, including simulation. We suggest that
              ongoing quality and process improvement systems be introduced and
              that certifying agencies move from a volume-based certification
              system to skill acquisition and knowledge-based competency
              assessment for trainees. We also suggest that assessment of skill
              maintenance and improvement in practice be evaluated regularly

              initial skill acquisition. CONCLUSIONS: The current methods used
              for bronchoscopy competency in training programs are variable. We

              from a volume- based certification system to a standardized skill

              from the patient's perspective. To address this gap, we examined

              symptoms to the start of treatment in Newfoundland and Labrador
              and aimed to describe wait times and efforts to improve
              timeliness of care from the patients' perspective. METHODS: We
              conducted qualitative interviews with 60 participants aged 19
              years or more with breast, colorectal, lung or prostate cancer
              who were recruited from a survey of patients with cancer that was
              carried out as an earlier part of a larger study. All survey
              participants had received care at regional cancer clinics in
              Newfoundland and Labrador and were selected by means of purposive
              sampling based on their type of cancer, level of satisfaction
              with care and place of residence (urban, semiurban or rural).
              Interviews were transcribed verbatim and coded by means of a
              thematic approach. RESULTS: Participants described actions taken
              by themselves, their families/friends or members of their health
              care team to reduce their wait for a diagnosis and/or treatment.
              In all instances, participants believed that these actions
              resulted in more timely care. Participants reported that
              ``insider knowledge'' of health care professionals (whether
              friends, family members or members of the care team) was
              particularly valuable in reducing delays. INTERPRETATION: The use
              of advocacy was relatively commonplace. The role of advocacy,
              whether it originates from patient or caregiver, is important to
              ensure access to timely, good-quality cancer care.",

              participants aged 50--75 years, who had smoked at some point in
              their life (ever-smokers), and who did not have a self-reported
              history of lung cancer. Participants had at least a 2\% 6-year
              risk of lung cancer as estimated by the PanCan model, a precursor
              to the validated PLCOm2012 model. Risk variables in the model

              into the study coordinating centre and were screened for PanCan
              risk. 15 were duplicates, so 7044 participants were considered
              for enrolment. Between Sept 24, 2008, and Dec 17, 2010, we
              recruited and enrolled 2537 eligible ever-smokers. After a median
              follow-up of 5·5 years (IQR 3·2--6·1), 172 lung cancers were
              diagnosed in 164 individuals (cumulative incidence 0·065 [95\% CI
              0·055--0·075], incidence rate 138·1 per 10 000 person-years
              [117·8--160·9]). There were ten interval lung cancers (6\% of
              lung cancers and 6\% of individuals with cancer): one diagnosed
              between T0 and T1, and nine between T1 and T4. Cumulative
              incidence was significantly higher than that observed in NLST
              (4·0\%; p<0·0001). Compared with 593 (57\%) of 1040 lung cancers
              observed in NLST, 133 (77\%) of 172 lung cancers in the PanCan
              Study were early stage (I or II; p<0·0001). The PanCan model was
              effective in identifying individuals who were subsequently
              diagnosed with early, potentially curable, lung cancer. The
              incidence of cancers detected and the proportion of early stage
              cancers in the screened population was higher than observed in
              previous studies. This approach should be considered for adoption
              in lung cancer screening programmes. Terry Fox Research Institute

              purpose of this study was to describe the demographic
              characteristics, medical conditions, health outcomes and resource
              use of patients admitted to general internal medicine at 7
              hospital sites in the Greater Toronto Area. METHODS: This was a
              retrospective cohort study involving all patients who were
              admitted to or discharged from general internal medicine at the
              study sites between Apr. 1, 2010, and Mar. 31, 2015. Clinical
              data from hospital electronic information systems were linked to
              administrative data from each hospital. We examined trends in
              resource use and patient characteristics over the study period.
              RESULTS: There were 136 208 admissions to general internal
              medicine involving 88 121 unique patients over the study period.
              General internal medicine admissions accounted for 38.8\% of all
              admissions from the emergency department and 23.7\% of all
              hospital bed-days. Over the study period, the number of
              admissions to general internal medicine increased by 32.4\%;
              there was no meaningful change in the median length of stay or
              cost per hospital stay. The median patient age was 73
              (interquartile range [IQR] 57-84) years, and the median number of
              coexisting conditions was 6 (IQR 3-9). The median acute length of
              stay was 4.6 (IQR 2.5-8.6) days, and the median total cost per
              hospital stay was \$5850 (IQR \$3915-\$10 061). Patients received
              at least 1 computed tomography scan in 52.2\% of admissions. The
              most common primary discharge diagnoses were pneumonia (5.0\% of
              admissions), heart failure (4.7\%), chronic obstructive pulmonary
              disease (4.1\%), urinary tract infection (4.0\%) and stroke
              (3.6\%). INTERPRETATION: Patients admitted to general internal
              medicine services represent a large, heterogeneous,
              resource-intensive and growing population. Understanding and
              improving general internal medicine care is essential to promote

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The evaluation of more than one intervention in the
              same randomised controlled trial can be achieved using a parallel
              group design. However this requires increased sample size and can
              be inefficient, especially if there is also interest in
              considering combinations of the interventions. An alternative may
              be a factorial trial, where for two interventions participants
              are allocated to receive neither intervention, one or the other,
              or both. Factorial trials require special considerations,
              however, particularly at the design and analysis stages.
              DISCUSSION: Using a 2 x 2 factorial trial as an example, we
              present a number of issues that should be considered when
              planning a factorial trial. The main design issue is that of
              sample size. Factorial trials are most often powered to detect
              the main effects of interventions, since adequate power to detect
              plausible interactions requires greatly increased sample sizes.
              The main analytical issues relate to the investigation of main
              effects and the interaction between the interventions in
              appropriate regression models. Presentation of results should
              reflect the analytical strategy with an emphasis on the principal
              research questions. We also give an example of how baseline and
              follow-up data should be presented. Lastly, we discuss the
              implications of the design, analytical and presentational issues
              covered. SUMMARY: Difficulties in interpreting the results of
              factorial trials if an influential interaction is observed is the
              cost of the potential for efficient, simultaneous consideration
              of two or more interventions. Factorial trials can in principle
              be designed to have adequate power to detect realistic
              interactions, and in any case they are the only design that
              allows such effects to be investigated.",

              difficulties in recruiting enough patients for conventional
              frequentist statistical analyses to provide an appropriate
              answer. These trials are often necessary for the study of rare
              diseases as well as specific study populations e.g. children. It
              has been estimated that there are between 6,000 and 8,000 rare
              diseases that cover a broad range of diseases and patients. In
              the European Union these diseases affect up to 30 million people,
              with about 50\% of those affected being children. Therapies for
              treating these rare diseases need their efficacy and safety
              evaluated but due to the small number of potential trial
              participants, a standard randomised controlled trial is often not
              feasible. There are a number of alternative trial designs to the
              usual parallel group design, each of which offers specific
              advantages, but they also have specific limitations. Thus the
              choice of the most appropriate design is not simple. METHODS:
              PubMed was searched to identify publications about the
              characteristics of different trial designs that can be used in
              randomised, comparative small clinical trials. In addition, the
              contents tables from 11 journals were hand-searched. An algorithm
              was developed using decision nodes based on the characteristics
              of the identified trial designs. RESULTS: We identified 75
              publications that reported the characteristics of 12 randomised,
              comparative trial designs that can be used in for the evaluation
              of therapies in orphan diseases. The main characteristics and the
              advantages and limitations of these designs were summarised and
              used to develop an algorithm that may be used to help select an
              appropriate design for a given clinical situation. We used
              examples from publications of given disease-treatment-outcome
              situations, in which the investigators had used a particular
              trial design, to illustrate the use of the algorithm for the
              identification of possible alternative designs. CONCLUSIONS: The
              algorithm that we propose could be a useful tool for the choice

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The detection of pulmonary nodules (PNs) is likely to
              increase, especially with the release of the National Lung Screen
              Trials. When tissue diagnosis is desired, transthoracic needle
              aspiration (TTNA) is recommended. Several guided-bronchoscopy
              technologies have been developed to improve the yield of
              transbronchial biopsy for PN diagnosis: electromagnetic
              navigation bronchoscopy (ENB), virtual bronchoscopy (VB), radial
              endobronchial ultrasound (R-EBUS), ultrathin bronchoscope, and
              guide sheath. We undertook this meta-analysis to determine the
              overall diagnostic yield of guided bronchoscopy using one or a
              combination of the modalities described here. METHODS: We
              performed a MEDLINE search using ``bronchoscopy'' and ``solitary
              pulmonary nodule.'' Studies evaluating the diagnostic yield of
              ENB, VB, R-EBUS, ultrathin bronchoscope, and/or guide sheath for
              peripheral nodules were included. The overall diagnostic yield
              and yield based on size were extracted. Adverse events, if
              reported, were recorded. Meta-analysis techniques incorporating
              inverse variance weighting and a random-effects meta-analysis
              approach were used. RESULTS: A total of 3,052 lesions from 39
              studies were included. The pooled diagnostic yield was 70\%,
              which is higher than the yield for traditional transbronchial
              biopsy. The yield increased as the lesion size increased. The
              pneumothorax rate was 1.5\%, which is significantly smaller than
              that reported for TTNA. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis shows that
              the diagnostic yield of guided bronchoscopic techniques is better
              than that of traditional transbronchial biopsy. Although the
              yield remains lower than that of TTNA, the procedural risk is
              lower. Guided bronchoscopy may be an alternative or be
              complementary to TTNA for tissue sampling of PN, but further
              study is needed to determine its role in the evaluation of
              peripheral pulmonary lesions.",

              <1.5 cm in maximal diameter over a 1-year period. Institutional

              Three separate models were created to reflect practice patterns

              in the study-78 underwent SWL and 80 underwent URS as primary
              treatment. Single procedure stone-free rates (SFR) for SWL and

              METHODS: A multicenter, prospective observational study was
              designed and conducted between March and December 2015. We
              included women having at least one stone in the distal ureter and
              being a candidate for surgical treatment using the 4.85F sheath
              of MicroPerc\textregistered{}. Patients with clinical criteria
              and/or laboratory analysis indicating sepsis or coagulation
              alteration were excluded. RESULTS: Thirty-nine women were
              operated in eight hospitals. The profile of the patients was
              fairly homogeneous among hospitals. Only differences were found
              in age, preoperative stent, and the result of the previous urine
              culture. Immediate stone-free status was achieved in 88.2\% and
              100\% 7 days after the procedure. 97.4\% of patients did not
              present any complication in the postoperative period, with only
              one case with complication Clavien II. Postureteroscopic Lesion
              Scale (PULS) in 76.9\% of patients did not show any injury,
              20.5\% had lesions grade 1, and grade 2 lesions 2.6\%. As for the

              (NSCLC) is critical for optimal management. Minimally invasive
              pathologic assessment of mediastinal lymphadenopathy is
              increasingly being performed. The cost-benefit (minimization of
              health care costs) of such approaches, in comparison with
              traditional surgical methods, is yet to be established. METHODS:
              Decision-tree analysis was applied to compare downstream costs of
              endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration
              (EBUS-TBNA), conventional TBNA, and surgical mediastinoscopy.
              Calculations were based on real costs derived from actual patient
              data at a major teaching hospital in Melbourne, Australia. One-
              and two-way sensitivity analyses were undertaken to account for
              potential variation in input parameter values. RESULTS: For the
              base-case analysis, initial evaluation with EBUS-TBNA (with
              negative results being surgically confirmed) was the most
              cost-beneficial approach (AU$2961) in comparison with EBUS-TBNA
              (negative results not surgically confirmed) ($3344), conventional
              TBNA ($3754), and mediastinoscopy ($8859). The sensitivity of
              EBUS-TBNA for detecting disease had the largest impact on cost,
              whereas the prevalence of mediastinal lymph node metastases
              determined whether surgical confirmation of negative EBUS-TBNA
              results remained cost-beneficial. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms
              that minimally invasive staging of NSCLC is cost-beneficial in
              comparison with traditional surgical techniques. EBUS-TBNA was
              the most cost-beneficial approach for mediastinal staging of

              is a valuable tool used for the diagnosis of countless thoracic
              diseases. Computed tomography (CT) is the most common imaging
              modality used for guidance followed by ultrasound (US) for
              lesions abutting the pleural surface. Novel approaches using
              virtual CT guidance have recently been introduced. The objective
              of this review is to examine the current literature for TTNA
              biopsy of the lung focusing on diagnostic accuracy and safety.
              METHODS: MEDLINE was searched from inception to October 2015 for
              all case series examining image guided TTNA. Articles focusing on
              fluoroscopic guidance as well as influence of rapid on-site
              evaluation (ROSE) on yield were excluded. The diagnostic
              accuracy, defined as the number of true positives divided by the
              number of biopsies done, as well as the complication rate
              [pneumothorax (PTX), bleeding] was examined for CT guided TTNA,
              US guided TTNA as well as CT guided electromagnetic
              navigational-TTNA (E-TTNA). Of the 490 articles recovered 75 were
              included in our analysis. RESULTS: The overall pooled diagnostic
              accuracy for CT guided TTNA using 48 articles that met the
              inclusion and exclusion criteria was 92.1\% (9,567/10,383). A
              similar yield was obtained examining ten articles using US guided
              TTNA of 88.7\% (446/503). E-TTNA, being a new modality, only had
              one pilot study citing a diagnostic accuracy of 83\% (19/23).
              Pooled PTX and hemorrhage rates were 20.5\% and 2.8\%
              respectively for CT guided TTNA. The PTX rate was lower in US
              guided TTNA at a pooled rate of 4.4\%. E-TTNA showed a similar
              rate of PTX at 20\% with no incidence of bleeding in a single
              pilot study available. CONCLUSIONS: Image guided TTNA is a safe
              and accurate modality for the biopsy of lung pathology. This

              lung-cancer staging. In standard practice, however, physicians
              differ greatly in their levels of performance. To address this
              concern, image-guided intervention (IGI) systems have been
              devised to improve procedure success. Current IGI bronchoscopy
              systems based on virtual bronchoscopic navigation (VBN), however,
              require involvement from the attending technician. This lessens
              physician control and hinders the overall acceptance of such
              systems. We propose a hands-free VBN system for planning and
              guiding bronchoscopy. The system introduces two major
              contributions. First, it incorporates a new procedure-planning
              method that automatically computes airway navigation plans
              conforming to the physician's bronchoscopy training and manual
              dexterity. Second, it incorporates a guidance strategy for

              via a foot switch, coupled with a novel position-verification
              mechanism. Phantom studies verified that the system enables
              smooth operation under physician control, while also enabling
              faster navigation than an existing technician-assisted VBN
              system. In a clinical human study, we noted a 97\% bronchoscopy
              navigation success rate, in line with existing VBN systems, and a
              mean guidance time per diagnostic site = 52 s. This represents a

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: The frequency of flexible ureteroscopy has
              increased with the introduction of improved instrumentation.
              Ureteroscopes allow increased endoscopic access to the ureter and
              kidney. However, maintenance and repair of scopes may increase
              the total procedure expense. METHODS: In 3 years (8/2011-7/2014),
              655 flexible ureteroscopies were performed at a single-specialty,
              urology, ambulatory surgery center. Procedures were performed by
              26 board-certified urologists using four Olympus URF P5 flexible
              ureteroscopes. The instruments were handled by a single team and
              sterilized through the STERIS System E1. Repairs were performed
              by the manufacturer on an as needed basis. Patient records were
              reviewed to determine the preoperative diagnosis, operative time,
              location and size of the stone, and use of laser or ureteral
              sheath. The occurrence, nature of flexible ureteroscope damage,
              and cost of repairs were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the
              ureteroscopies performed, 78\% was for the treatment of calculi
              (50.1\% in the kidney). Mean stone size was 8.5 $\pm$ 0.2 mm,
              with larger stones (11 mm) located in the kidney. The flexible
              ureteroscope was advanced over a guidewire (88\% of cases); a
              laser fiber was introduced in 70\%, and a ureteral sheath was
              used in 13.4\%. Mean procedure time was 40 minutes. The most
              common reasons for ureteroscope repair were cloudy lens (16
              repairs) and broken optic fibers (9 repairs). There were 31
              repairs during the study period (average 21 cases per repair).
              Flexible ureteroscopes were out of service for an average of 11
              days per repair (range 3-20). The total cost of repairs was
              \$233,150 or ∼\$7521 per repair. The average repair cost per
              flexible ureteroscopy performed was \$355. CONCLUSIONS: Expenses
              associated with instrument repair can significantly impact a
              procedure's net revenue, thus efforts should be made to minimize
              instrument breakage. The expense of repairing a flexible
              ureteroscope per procedure can be significant and needs to be
              considered when pricing this procedure.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND AIM: This study attempts to estimate the
              socioeconomic differences between three major alternatives for
              the management of upper and lower ureteral lithiasis. MATERIAL
              AND METHODS: Two hundred and forty patients with upper and lower
              ureteral lithiasis, have been studied retrospectively, divided in
              six equal groups of forty. These patients have been treated
              either by extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (SWL), or with
              ureteroscopy with semirigid ureteroscope and the use of pneumatic
              lithoclast, or with ureteroscopy with flexible ureteroscope and
              the use of Holmium YAG Laser. For cost calculation, the
              reimbursement fee paid by insurance to the hospital was taken
              into account. For the estimation of the social burden, the length
              of hospital stay and the number of outpatient visits have been
              included as countable parameters. RESULTS: The percentage of
              effective stone removal for upper ureter was 81.0\% for SWL,
              62.5\% for ureteroscopy with semirigid ureteroscope and the use
              of pneumatic lithoclast and, 82.5\% for ureteroscopy with
              flexible ureteroscope and the use of Holmium YAG Laser. The same
              percentages for lower ureter were 82.5\%, 92.5\% and 97.5\%
              respectively. The cost of stone removal for both the upper and
              lower ureter using extracorporeal lithotripsy was significantly
              higher compared to the other two procedures (median cost for
              upper ureter 828 € vs 474.50 € and 396 € respectively, and for
              lower ureter 826 € vs 396 € and 271 €, p<0.001). Regarding the
              social aspect, SWL is mainly an outpatient procedure, requiring a
              short hospital stay (for upper ureter 1.63 vs 2.48 and 2.45
              respectively and for lower ureter 1.35 vs 2.43 and 2.13days), but
              needing more and prevailing clinic visits (for upper ureter 1.43
              vs 1.45 and 1 respectively and for lower ureter 1.45 vs 1.15 and
              0.55 visitsgive numbers, compare), both in outpatient and in
              accident and emergency (A\&E) department. CONCLUSION: The
              increase in the expenses with regard to health management
              indicates the necessity of cost accounting the health programs
              including the medical procedures as a means to improve the
              relation between cost and benefit.",

              requirements. Moreover, some of the guidelines for simulation
              design are specialty specific. STUDY DESIGN: We designed a model
              that integrates best practices for effective simulation-based
              training and a modification of Kern et al.'s 6-step approach for
              curriculum development. We invited international simulation and
              health professions education experts to complete a questionnaire

              modifications from respondents and reached consensus on a revised
              version of the model. RESULTS: We recruited 17 simulation and
              education experts. They expressed a consensus on the seven
              proposed curricular steps: problem identification and general
              needs assessment, targeted needs assessment, goals and

              using the 5\% Medicare claims data (January 1, 2009, to December
              31, 2011) was conducted. Patients aged 65 to 74 years with an
              abnormal chest CT scan were identified. Index was defined as the
              date of the abnormal chest CT scan. Outcomes assessed over a

              rate and the use and associated costs of follow-up diagnostic
              tests up to diagnosis of lung cancer. RESULTS: Of 8979 patients
              identified with an abnormal chest CT scan (mean age, 69.3 $\pm$
              2.9 years), 13.9\% were diagnosed with lung cancer over 12
              months. Chest x-rays were the most common diagnostic test. Of the

              aspiration, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and brushing for the
              diagnosis of pulmonary neoplasia not visible endoscopically.
              METHODS: We retrospectively assessed 207 consecutive patients
              with a final diagnosis of peripheral lung malignancy who
              underwent bronchoscopy with non-guided aspiration, brushing, and
              BAL as their initial evaluation. The influence of clinical and
              radiological factors on diagnostic yield was assessed using
              univariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: The overall
              sensitivity of non-guided bronchoscopy was 25.6\%, whereas
              sensitivities for bronchial aspiration, BAL, and brushing were
              14.2\%, 11.6\%, and 16.5\%, respectively. Younger age, larger
              lesion, central/intermediate distance from the hilum, presence of
              a bronchus sign, and higher standardized uptake value (SUV) on
              positron emission tomography scan were predictors of a higher
              diagnostic yield. Conversely, forced expiratory volume in one
              second, fellow implication in the procedure, and tumor histology
              did not influence sensitivity. The overall sensitivity of
              bronshoscopy was >40\% for tumors >4 cm, located in the
              central/intermediate thirds of the lung, showing a bronchus sign,
              with an SUV >12 or occurring in patients <50 years of age.
              Conversely, the sensitivity was <10\% for tumors <2 cm, located

              characteristics may help targeting situations in which
              conventional bronchoscopy could be used as the initial diagnostic
              procedure when advanced techniques are unavailable. However,

              controversial. Moreover, the optimal timing of washing relative
              to biopsy and brushing is not known. In this study, the

              MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-one patients
              underwent flexible bronchoscopy, and the diagnostic yield of
              washings before biopsy and brushing (strategy I) and after biopsy
              and brushing (strategy II) specimens were assessed. Using the
              known probabilities and costs for various bronchoscopic
              procedures, the expected utility of a number of diagnostic
              strategies was estimated. Patients (147 men and 74 women) were
              included in the study in whom a definite cytologic or histologic
              diagnosis of pulmonary malignancy had been made. The diagnostic
              yield of strategy I was 72\% for visible tumors and 36\% for
              nonvisible tumors. For strategy II, the diagnostic yield was 74\%
              for visible tumors and in 42\% for nonvisible tumors. The
              comparison of strategies I and II for both visible and nonvisible
              tumors revealed that 176 cases were concordant (80\%); in 19
              cases (9\%) the cytologic analysis of washings in strategy I was
              positive for malignancy and negative in strategy II. In 26 cases
              (12\%) washings in strategy II were positive and negative in
              strategy I (p = 0.37). An analysis of the diagnostic yield of
              both washings in visible tumors and nonvisible tumors showed no
              significant difference. In 13 patients, a diagnosis of malignancy
              was established only by washings (6\%). Confining the laboratory
              investigations of washings or brush samples to those cases in
              which the initial findings of the biopsies are negative (the
              two-stage procedure) is more cost-effective than examining all
              biopsy, brushing, and washing specimens. In patients with visible
              tumors, brushing or washing in addition to biopsy is equally
              cost-effective; in patients with nonvisible tumors, biopsy
              combined with washing is the preferred option. CONCLUSIONS: No
              difference in the diagnostic yield could be demonstrated for
              washings before or after biopsies and brushings. Although the
              additional diagnostic yield of washing and brushing during
              bronchoscopy is relatively low, it is cost-effective to use these
              procedures in the diagnostic workup of patients who are
              clinically suspected of having a pulmonary malignancy.",

  abstract = "The progressive increase of the social cost for treating
              urolithiasis could be related to an increased incidence of the
              disease and/or to an increase of costs for diagnosing and
              treating renal stones. In the course of the last century, the
              incidence of renal stones has progressively increased in Europe,
              North America, and other industrialised countries. This has been
              explained in terms of changing social conditions and the
              consequent changes in eating habits. In contrast, renal stones
              were less frequent than in developing countries of the world but
              in the last 20 years investigators began to report high
              incidences of upper urinary stone disease also from some areas of
              the Third World concurring with the changing of economic and
              social conditions. Each stone episode involves the costs for
              emergency visits, diagnostic work up, and medical or surgical
              treatment. Furthermore, we have to consider the costs of
              follow-up visits and the costs of testing and drugs for stone
              prevention. In adjunct of direct costs for diagnosis and
              treatment, we should also take into account the indirect
              individual and social cost of workdays lost. Finally, we should
              estimate the costs of complications and outcomes of treatment
              with particular attention to the costs of chronic renal failure
              secondary to stone disease. The strategy of treatment of each
              stone centre involves different costs for the treatment of each
              single stone episode. On the other hand the choice of treatment
              can be driven by National Health Systems and insurance companies

              trends of renal stone incidence will have different impact on
              health care systems in different countries. In Europe and North
              America, the peak of incidence has been probably reached but the
              increase of costs for diagnosing and treating each single stone
              episode will still increase the social cost for managing stone
              disease. For this reason the actual objective should be to
              optimise protocols avoiding redundant or expensive diagnostic
              procedures or inappropriate treatments. In developing countries,
              the incidence of stone disease is still increasing and it could
              reach peaks even higher as a consequence of hot climate in some
              geographical areas. In those countries the demand for treatment
              of symptomatic stones could dramatically increase involving a

              and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). We studied the
              relative cost-effective initial diagnostic strategy for a 1.5- to
              2-cm nodule suggestive of cancer. METHODS: A decision analysis
              model was developed to assess the costs and outcomes of four
              initial diagnostic strategies for diagnosis of a 1.5- to 2-cm
              nodule with either a 50\% or 65\% pretest probability of cancer.
              Medicare reimbursement rates were used for costs.
              Quality-adjusted life years were estimated using patient survival
              based on pathologic staging and utilities derived from the
              literature. RESULTS: When cancer prevalence was 65\%, tissue
              acquisition strategies of NB and CT-FNA had higher
              quality-adjusted life years compared with either FDG-PET or VATS,
              and VATS was the most costly strategy. In sensitivity analyses,
              NB and CT-FNA were more cost-effective than FDG-PET when FDG-PET
              specificity was less than 72\%. When cancer prevalence was 50\%,

              CONCLUSIONS: Both NB and CT-FNA diagnostic strategies are more

              diagnose lung cancer in moderate- to high-risk nodules and

              can be malignant. Both computed tomography-guided biopsy and
              electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy (ENB) with biopsy can
              be used to diagnose a SPN. A nondiagnostic computed tomography
              (CT)-guided or ENB biopsy is often followed by video-assisted
              thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) biopsy. The relative costs and
              consequences of these strategies are not known. METHODS: A
              decision tree was created with values from the literature to
              evaluate the clinical consequences and societal costs of a
              CT-guided biopsy strategy versus an ENB biopsy strategy for the
              diagnosis of a SPN. The serial use of ENB after nondiagnostic
              CT-guided biopsy and CT-guided biopsy after nondiagnostic ENB
              biopsy were tested as alternate strategies. RESULTS: In a
              hypothetical cohort of 100 patients, use of the ENB biopsy
              strategy on average results in 13.4 fewer pneumothoraces, 5.9
              fewer chest tubes, 0.9 fewer significant hemorrhage episodes, and
              0.6 fewer respiratory failure episodes compared with a CT-guided
              biopsy strategy. ENB biopsy increases average costs by \$3719 per
              case and increases VATS rates by an absolute 20\%. The sequential
              diagnostic strategy that combines CT-guided biopsy after
              nondiagnostic ENB biopsy and vice versa decreases the rate of
              VATS procedures to 3\%. A sequential approach starting with ENB
              decreases average per case cost relative to CT-guided biopsy
              followed by VATS, if needed, by \$507; and a sequential approach
              starting with CT-guided biopsy decreases the cost relative to
              CT-guided biopsy followed by VATS, if needed, by \$979.
              CONCLUSIONS: An ENB with biopsy strategy is associated with
              decreased pneumothorax rate but increased costs and increased use
              of VATS. Combining CT-guided biopsy and ENB with biopsy serially

                   is anticipated to drive personalized medicine and improve
                   healthcare quality. Constructing predictive statistical
                   models typically requires extraction of curated predictor
                   variables from normalized EHR data, a labor-intensive
                   process that discards the vast majority of information in
                   each patient's record. We propose a representation of
                   patients' entire, raw EHR records based on the Fast
                   Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) format. We
                   demonstrate that deep learning methods using this
                   representation are capable of accurately predicting multiple
                   medical events from multiple centers without site-specific
                   data harmonization. We validated our approach using
                   de-identified EHR data from two U.S. academic medical
                   centers with 216,221 adult patients hospitalized for at
                   least 24 hours. In the sequential format we propose, this
                   volume of EHR data unrolled into a total of 46,864,534,945
                   data points, including clinical notes. Deep learning models
                   achieved high accuracy for tasks such as predicting
                   in-hospital mortality (AUROC across sites 0.93-0.94), 30-day
                   unplanned readmission (AUROC 0.75-0.76), prolonged length of
                   stay (AUROC 0.85-0.86), and all of a patient's final
                   discharge diagnoses (frequency-weighted AUROC 0.90). These
                   models outperformed state-of-the-art traditional predictive
                   models in all cases. We also present a case-study of a
                   neural-network attribution system, which illustrates how
                   clinicians can gain some transparency into the predictions.
                   We believe that this approach can be used to create accurate

               catheters are steered through the vasculature from the insertion
               point in the groin area to the atrium. The outcome of this
               procedure depends on a number of factors, among which is the
               correct placement of the catheter tip on the target tissue. The
               tip/tissue contact angle is adjusted by using a manual prismatic
               knob on the proximal handle to bend the deflectable distal shaft
               of the catheter. With the goal of developing a robotics-assisted
               catheter manipulation system, in this paper, we focus on the
               problem of controlling the bending of the distal shaft when the
               proximal handle is used within a robotic manipulator. To this
               end, we apply the black-box modeling technique and perform an
               extensive experimental study to characterize the behavior of the
               catheter. The relationship between proximal measurements and the
               distal tip angle is then determined by fitting a model to the

               control system that adjusts the bending of the distal shaft
               merely based on proximal measurements with no feedback from the
               distal end. The performance of the designed control scheme is
               evaluated through experimental implementation. The results show

              been made in visualization devices and instrumentation. METHODS:
              Our team, composed of surgeons and biomedical engineers,
              developed a magnetic levitation camera (MLC) with a magnetic
              internal mechanism dedicated to MIS. Three animal trials were

              nephrectomy and hernioplastic repair have been performed.
              RESULTS: MLC permits to complete efficiently several two-port
              laparoscopy surgeries reducing patients' invasiveness and at the
              same time saving surgeon's dexterity. CONCLUSIONS: We strongly

              (FBG) sensors have been integrated into needle-sized continuum
              robots for shape estimation and force measurement. The challenge
              in extending previous shape and force sensing technologies to
              pre-curved continuum robots, such as concentric-tube robots, is
              that torsion information is essential for accurate shape
              estimation, and the force-strain relationship is nonlinear. In
              this letter, a novel helically wrapped FBG sensor design and
              corresponding force-curvature-strain model are developed to
              provide simultaneous curvature, torsion, and force measurement.
              To validate this design and modeling technique, two sensorized
              Nitinol tubes were fabricated and tested in an experimental
              setup. The results showed that accurate and sensitive curvature,

              disability in the Canadian population and are associated with a
              large public health burden. An increase in life expectancy and a
              declining birth rate has resulted in an aging Canadian
              population, and the proportion of age-adjusted mortality due to
              non-communicable diseases has been steadily increasing. These
              conditions are frequently associated with chronic disability and
              an increasing burden of care for patients, their families and

              laparoscopic or open approaches for four types of operative
              procedures between 2006 and 2014: (1) anterior resection (AR),

              number of hospitals performing robotic rectal surgery has
              increased. Low anterior resection accounts for the largest
              percentage of robotic surgeries (mean 67.2\%), and the number and
              proportion of ISRs performed robotically have increased rapidly
              (mean 22.6\%). In addition, the dependence on robotic methods for

              The use of robotic rectal surgery has widened over the last
              decade in Korea, and it has been convergent with surgeries for

              comparing robot-assisted (RA) and freehand (FH) conventional
              techniques for pedicle screw fixation have been published, but
              the results are unclear. Here, we assessed current evidence
              regarding the efficiency, safety and accuracy of RA compared with
              FH techniques. METHODS: A literature search of PubMed, Embase,
              the Cochrane Library and Web of Science was performed to compare
              the differences between RA and FH in spine surgery. Two reviewers
              independently reviewed included studies, conducted a risk of bias
              assessment, and extracted data. RESULTS: Three randomized
              controlled trials (RCTs) and six retrospective comparative
              studies included a total of 750 patients (3625 pedicle screws).
              No significant differences were noted between RA and FH in
              pedicle screw accuracy (95.5\% compared with 92.9\%; odds ratio:
              1.35; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.55 to 3.30; P=0.51),
              overall complication rate (1.33\% compared with 3.45\%; odds
              ratio: 0.46; 95\% CI, 0.15 to 1.43; P=0.18) and radiation
              exposure time (weighted mean difference [WMD]:8.49; 95\% CI,
              -15.43 to 32.40; P=0.49). While RA was associated with a longer
              operative time (WMD: 39.63; 95\% CI, 5.27 to 73.99; P= 0.02),
              percutaneous or minimal robot-assisted pedicle screw fixation

              -33.10; 95\% CI, -38.18 to -28.02; P=0.00) CONCLUSIONS: The
              current literature did not prove that RA supersedes FH, although
              several studies are more optimistic about this procedure. Future
              well-designed RCTs assessing RA and FH are needed to confirm and

  abstract = "PURPOSE: Bronchoscopy for peripheral pulmonary lesions continues
              to present challenges to clinicians. One potential limitation may
              be the inability to advance conventional bronchoscopes into close
              proximity of peripheral lesions prior to biopsy. This study was
              performed to assess the reach of a robotic endoscopic system
              within human cadaveric lungs compared to conventional thin
              bronchoscopes. DESCRIPTION: All segmental bronchi (RB1-10,
              LB1-10) were accessed in two human cadavers using a conventional
              thin bronchoscope and robotic endoscope of identical outer
              diameter. Bronchus generation count and insertion depth measured
              by electromagnetic navigation and external fluoroscopy were
              recorded. EVALUATION: The robotic endoscope was advanced beyond
              the conventional thin bronchoscope in all segments, particularly
              in bronchi with increased angulation such as RB1 (mean generation
              count 8 vs. 3.5, respectively) and LB1+2 (mean generation count 8
              vs. 4.5). CONCLUSIONS: The robotic endoscopic system was advanced
              beyond a conventional thin bronchoscope with identical outer
              diameter into the periphery of human cadaveric lungs. Improved
              reach within the lung periphery may address some limitations with

              therapy (RAST), a noninvasive and nonthermal focused ultrasound
              therapy based on histotripsy. Materials and Methods This study
              was approved by the institutional animal use and care committee.
              Ten female pigs were treated with RAST in a single session with a
              prescribed 3-cm spherical treatment region and immediately
              underwent abdominal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Three pigs
              (acute group) were sacrificed immediately following MR imaging.
              Seven pigs (chronic group) were survived for approximately 4
              weeks and were reimaged with MR imaging immediately before
              sacrifice. Animals underwent necropsy and harvesting of the liver
              for histologic evaluation of the ablation zone. RAST ablations
              were performed with a 700-kHz therapy transducer. Student t tests
              were performed to compare prescribed versus achieved ablation
              diameter, difference of sphericity from 1, and change in ablation
              zone volume from acute to chronic imaging. Results Ablation zones
              had a sphericity index of 0.99 $\pm$ 0.01 (standard deviation) (P
              < .001 vs sphericity index of 1). Anteroposterior and transverse
              dimensions were not significantly different from prescribed (3.4
              $\pm$ 0.7; P = .08 and 3.2 $\pm$ 0.8; P = .29, respectively). The
              craniocaudal dimension was significantly larger than prescribed
              (3.8 $\pm$ 1.1; P = .04), likely because of respiratory motion.
              The central ablation zone demonstrated complete cell destruction
              and a zone of partial necrosis. A fibrous capsule surrounded the
              ablation zone by 4 weeks. On 4-week follow-up images, ablation
              zone volumes decreased by 64\% (P < .001). Conclusion RAST is
              capable of producing clinically relevant ablation zones in a
              noninvasive manner in a porcine model. \copyright{} RSNA, 2018.",

              of surgical education for the last two decades. The Accreditation
              Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) changed the
              requirements for laparoscopic cases beginning with graduates in
              2008, and the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery program was
              introduced over a decade ago as a method of measuring competency

              determine what changes have been made to meet these requirements
              and how these changes have impacted general surgery residents in
              their preparation to perform both basic and complex laparoscopic
              procedures upon completion of residency. METHODS: A 23-question
              survey was distributed electronically to all fourth- and
              fifth-year residents of United States general surgery residency
              programs. Respondents were queried about demographics, perception
              of surgical education, and their level of preparedness to perform
              laparoscopic cases upon graduation. RESULTS: The survey was
              completed by a total of 321 residents (174 fourth-year and 147
              fifth-year). Nineteen percent of respondents indicated that they
              anticipated problems meeting the new ACGME guidelines and 18.7\%
              of all respondents indicated that changes had been made to their
              program to meet those new requirements. The majority of residents
              felt they had adequate laparoscopic training upon graduation, but
              there was a disparity between program types. Despite this

              preparing future surgeons to perform with confidence upon
              completion of residency training. The majority of residents feel
              their training has been adequate, but there are also a great
              number who believe they will need to continue their education in

              objectives of this analysis were to calculate costs for the first
              year post-stroke and determine the impact of disability on costs.
              METHODOLOGY: The Economic Burden of Ischemic Stroke (BURST) Study
              was a one-year prospective study with a cohort of ischemic stroke
              patients recruited at 12 Canadian stroke centres. Clinical
              history, disability, health preference and resource utilization
              information was collected at discharge, three months, six months
              and one year. Resources included direct medical costs (2009
              CAN\$) such as emergency services, hospitalizations,
              rehabilitation, physician services, diagnostics, medications,
              allied health professional services, homecare, medical/assistive
              devices, changes to residence and paid caregivers, as well as
              indirect costs. Results were stratified by disability measured at
              discharge using the modified Rankin Score (mRS): non-disabling
              stroke (mRS 0-2) and disabling stroke (mRS 3-5). RESULTS: We
              enrolled 232 ischemic stroke patients (age 69.4 \pm 15.4 years;
              51.3\% male) and 113 (48.7\%) were disabled at hospital
              discharge. The average annual cost was \$74,353; \$107,883 for
              disabling strokes and \$48,339 for non-disabling strokes.
              CONCLUSIONS: An average annual cost for ischemic stroke was
              calculated in which a disabling stroke was associated with a
              two-fold increase in costs compared to NDS. Costs during the
              hospitalization to three months phase were the highest
              contributor to the annual cost. A ``back of the envelope''

              would overcome some limitations of conventional surgery, and has
              good prospects. METHODS: A total of 15 patients received cerebral
              angiography assisted by a vascular interventional robot following
              preoperative examination, with approval from the hospital ethics
              committee and informed consent by the patients' families.
              RESULTS: Robot-assisted angiography was performed quickly and
              smoothly without surgical complications. The remote positioning
              accuracy was 1.05 $\pm$ 0.28 mm. The time staff were exposed to
              the digital subtraction angiography (DSA) machine was 0 min. The
              entire experimental process was mechanized and automated.
              CONCLUSION: This system achieved the preliminary purposes,
              including a reduction in radiation for the surgeons, facilitation
              of the application of interventional procedures, a decrease in
              operation time, and an improvement in operation quality.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness
              of coil embolization compared with surgical clipping to treat
              intracranial aneurysms. THE TECHNOLOGY: Endovascular coil
              embolization is a percutaneous approach to treat an intracranial
              aneurysm from within the blood vessel without the need of a
              craniotomy. In this procedure, a microcatheter is inserted into
              the femoral artery near the groin and navigated to the site of
              the aneurysm. Small helical platinum coils are deployed through
              the microcatheter to fill the aneurysm, and prevent it from
              further expansion and rupture. Health Canada has approved
              numerous types of coils and coil delivery systems to treat
              intracranial aneurysms. The most favoured are controlled
              detachable coils. Coil embolization may be used with other
              adjunct endovascular devices such as stents and balloons.
              BACKGROUND: INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS: Intracranial aneurysms are
              the dilation or ballooning of part of a blood vessel in the
              brain. Intracranial aneurysms range in size from small (25 mm).
              There are 3 main types of aneurysms. Fusiform aneurysms involve
              the entire circumference of the artery; saccular aneurysms have
              outpouchings; and dissecting aneurysms have tears in the arterial
              wall. Berry aneurysms are saccular aneurysms with well-defined
              necks. Intracranial aneurysms may occur in any blood vessel of
              the brain; however, they are most commonly found at the branch
              points of large arteries that form the circle of Willis at the
              base of the brain. In 85\% to 95\% of patients, they are found in
              the anterior circulation. Aneurysms in the posterior circulation
              are less frequent, and are more difficult to treat surgically due
              to inaccessibility. Most intracranial aneurysms are small and
              asymptomatic. Large aneurysms may have a mass effect, causing
              compression on the brain and cranial nerves and neurological
              deficits. When an intracranial aneurysm ruptures and bleeds,
              resulting in a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), the mortality rate
              can be 40\% to 50\%, with severe morbidity of 10\% to 20\%. The
              reported overall risk of rupture is 1.9\% per year and is higher
              for women, cigarette smokers, and cocaine users, and in aneurysms
              that are symptomatic, greater than 10 mm in diameter, or located
              in the posterior circulation. If left untreated, there is a
              considerable risk of repeat hemorrhage in a ruptured aneurysm
              that results in increased mortality. In Ontario, intracranial
              aneurysms occur in about 1\% to 4\% of the population, and the
              annual incidence of SAH is about 10 cases per 100,000 people. In
              2004-2005, about 660 intracranial aneurysm repairs were performed
              in Ontario. TREATMENT OF INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS: Treatment of an
              unruptured aneurysm attempts to prevent the aneurysm from
              rupturing. The treatment of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm aims
              to prevent further hemorrhage. There are 3 approaches to treating
              an intracranial aneurysm. Small, asymptomatic aneurysms less than
              10 mm in diameter may be monitored without any intervention other
              than treatment for underlying risk factors such as hypertension.
              Open surgical clipping, involves craniotomy, brain retraction,
              and placement of a silver clip across the neck of the aneurysm
              while a patient is under general anesthesia. This procedure is
              associated with surgical risks and neurological deficits.
              Endovascular coil embolization, introduced in the 1990s, is the
              health technology under review. LITERATURE REVIEW: METHODS: The
              Medical Advisory Secretariat searched the International Health
              Technology Assessment (INAHTA) Database and the Cochrane Database
              of Systematic Reviews to identify relevant systematic reviews.
              OVID Medline, Medline In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations,
              and Embase were searched for English-language journal articles
              that reported primary data on the effectiveness or
              cost-effectiveness of treatments for intracranial aneurysms,
              obtained in a clinical setting or analyses of primary data
              maintained in registers or institutional databases. Internet
              searches of Medscape and manufacturers' databases were conducted
              to identify product information and recent reports on trials that
              were unpublished but that were presented at international
              conferences. Four systematic reviews, 3 reports on 2 randomized
              controlled trials comparing coil embolization with surgical
              clipping of ruptured aneurysms, 30 observational studies, and 3
              economic analysis reports were included in this review. RESULTS:
              SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS: Coil embolization appears to be a safe
              procedure. Complications associated with coil embolization ranged
              from 8.6\% to 18.6\% with a median of about 10.6\%. Observational
              studies showed that coil embolization is associated with lower
              complication rates than surgical clipping (permanent complication
              3-7\% versus 10.9\%; overall 23\% versus 46\% respectively,
              p=0.009). Common complications of coil embolization are
              thrombo-embolic events (2.5\%-14.5\%), perforation of aneurysm
              (2.3\%-4.7\%), parent artery obstruction (2\%-3\%), collapsed
              coils (8\%), coil malposition (14.6\%), and coil migration
              (0.5\%-3\%). Randomized controlled trials showed that for
              ruptured intracranial aneurysms with SAH, suitable for both coil
              embolization and surgical clipping (mostly saccular aneurysms <10
              mm in diameter located in the anterior circulation) in people
              with good clinical condition:Coil embolization resulted in a
              statistically significant 23.9\% relative risk reduction and 7\%
              absolute risk reduction in the composite rate of death and
              dependency compared to surgical clipping (modified Rankin score
              3-6) at 1-year. The advantage of coil embolization over surgical
              clipping varies widely with aneurysm location, but endovascular
              treatment seems beneficial for all sites. There were less deaths
              in the first 7 years following coil embolization compared to
              surgical clipping (10.8\% vs 13.7\%). This survival benefit
              seemed to be consistent over time, and was statistically
              significant (log-rank p= 0.03). Coil embolization is associated
              with less frequent MRI-detected superficial brain deficits and
              ischemic lesions at 1-year. The 1- year rebleeding rate was 2.4\%
              after coil embolization and 1\% for surgical clipping. Confirmed
              rebleeding from the repaired aneurysm after the first year and up
              to year eight was low and not significantly different between
              coil embolization and surgical clipping (7 patients for coil
              embolization vs 2 patients for surgical clipping, log-rank
              p=0.22). Observational studies showed that patients with SAH and
              good clinical grade had better 6-month outcomes and lower risk of
              symptomatic cerebral vasospasm after coil embolization compared
              to surgical clipping. For unruptured intracranial aneurysms,
              there were no randomized controlled trials that compared coil
              embolization to surgical clipping. Large observational studies
              showed that: The risk of rupture in unruptured aneurysms less
              than 10 mm in diameter is about 0.05\% per year for patients with
              no pervious history of SAH from another aneurysm. The risk of
              rupture increases with history of SAH and as the diameter of the
              aneurysm reaches 10 mm or more. Coil embolization reduced the
              composite rate of in hospital deaths and discharge to long-term
              or short-term care facilities compared to surgical clipping (Odds
              Ratio 2.2, 95\% CI 1.6-3.1, p<0.001). The improvement in
              discharge disposition was highest in people older than 65 years.
              In-hospital mortality rate following treatment of intracranial
              aneurysm ranged from 0.5\% to 1.7\% for coil embolization and
              from 2.1\% to 3.5\% for surgical clipping. The overall 1-year
              mortality rate was 3.1\% for coil embolization and 2.3\% for
              surgical clipping. One-year morbidity rate was 6.4\% for coil
              embolization and 9.8\% for surgical clipping. It is not clear
              whether these differences were statistically significant. Coil
              embolization is associated with shorter hospital stay compared to
              surgical clipping. For both ruptured and unruptured aneurysms,
              the outcome of coil embolization does not appear to be dependent
              on age, whereas surgical clipping has been shown to yield worse
              outcome for patients older than 64 years. ANGIOGRAPHIC EFFICIENCY
              AND RECURRENCES: The main drawback of coil embolization is its
              low angiographic efficiency. The percentage of complete aneurysm
              occlusion after coil embolization (27\%-79\%, median 55\%)
              remains lower than that achieved with surgical clipping
              (82\%-100\%). However, about 90\% of coiled aneurysms achieve
              near total occlusion or better. Incompletely coiled aneurysms
              have been shown to have higher aneurysm recurrence rates ranging
              from 7\% to 39\% for coil embolization compared to 2.9\% for
              surgical clipping. Recurrence is defined as refilling of the
              neck, sac, or dome of a successfully treated aneurysm as shown on
              an angiogram. The long-term clinical significance of incomplete
              occlusion following coil embolization is unknown, but in one case
              series, 20\% of patients had major recurrences, and 50\% of these
              required further treatment. LONG-TERM OUTCOMES: A large
              international randomized trial reported that the survival benefit
              from coil embolization was sustained for at least 7 years. The
              rebleeding rate between year 2 and year 8 following coil
              embolization was low and not significantly different from that of
              surgical clipping. However, high quality long-term angiographic
              evidence is lacking. Accordingly, there is uncertainty about
              long-term occlusion status, coil durability, and recurrence
              rates. While surgical clipping is associated with higher
              immediate procedural risks, its long-term effectiveness has been
              established. INDICATIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS: Coil embolization
              offers treatment for people at increased risk for craniotomy,
              such as those over 65 years of age, with poor clinical status, or
              with comorbid conditions. The technology also makes it possible
              to treat surgical high-risk aneurysms. Not all aneurysms are
              suitable for coil embolization. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)",

              in a virtual reality (VR) workstation and present outcomes with
              respect to mortality, morbidity, and aneurysm occlusion rate.
              METHODS: Between 2006 and 2015, the clipping of 115 intracranial
              aneurysms in 105 patients was preoperatively planned with the
              Dextroscope, a stereoscopic, patient-specific VR environment. The
              outcome data for all cases, planned and performed in 3
              institutions, were analyzed based on clinical charts and
              radiologic reports. RESULTS: Eighty-five incidental, unruptured
              aneurysms in 77 patients were electively planned and treated
              surgically. Mortality was 0\% and morbidity (modified Rankin
              Scale score >2) was 2.6\%. The rate of complete aneurysm
              obliteration on postoperative imaging was 91.8\%. In addition, 30
              aneurysms were treated in 28 patients with previous subarachnoid

              (modified Rankin Scale score >2) 7.1\%, and the rate of complete
              aneurysm clipping was 90\%. CONCLUSIONS: Meticulous
              three-dimensional surgical planning in a VR environment enhances
              the surgeon's spatial understanding of the individual vascular
              anatomy and allows clip preselection and positioning as well as
              anticipation of potential difficulties and complications. VR
              planning was associated, in this multi-institutional series, with

              aneurysms for effective treatment. We have already reported that
              coil insertion force could be smaller and more stable when the
              coil delivery wire is driven mechanically at a constant speed.
              Another background is the difficulty in synchronizing operators'
              minds and hands when two operators control the microcatheter and
              the coil respectively. We have therefore developed a mechanical
              coil insertion system enabling a single operator to insert coils
              at a fixed speed while controlling the microcatheter. Using our
              new system, the operator manipulated the microcatheter with both
              hands and drove the coil using foot switches simultaneously. A
              delivery wire force sensor previously reported was used
              concurrently, allowing the operator to detect excessive stress on
              the wire. In vitro coil embolization was performed using three
              methods: simple mechanical advance of the coil; simple mechanical
              advance of the coil with microcatheter control; and driving
              (forward and backward) of the coil using foot switches in
              addition to microcatheter control. The system worked without any
              problems, and did not interfere with any procedures. In
              experimental coil embolization, delivery wire control using the
              foot switches as well as microcatheter manipulation helped to
              achieve successful insertion of coils. This system could offer
              the possibility of developing safer and more efficient coil
              embolization. Although we aim at total mechanization and
              automation of procedures in the future, microcatheter
              manipulation and synchronized delivery wire control are still
              indispensable using this system.",

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: In endovascular embolization for intracranial
              aneurysms, it is important to properly control the coil insertion
              force. However, the force can only be subjectively detected by
              the subtle feedback experienced by neurointerventionists at their
              fingertips. The authors envisioned a system that would
              objectively sense and quantify that force. In this article, coil
              insertion force was measured in cases of intracranial aneurysm
              using this sensor, and its actual clinical application was
              investigated. METHODS: The sensor consists of a hemostatic valve
              (Y-connector). A little flexure was intentionally added in the
              device, and it creates a bend in the delivery wire. The sensor
              measures the change in the position of the bent wire depending on
              the insertion force and translates it into a force value. Using
              this, embolization was performed for 10 unruptured intracranial
              aneurysms. RESULTS: The sensor adequately recorded the force, and
              it reflected the operators' usual clinical experience. The
              presence of the sensor did not affect the procedures. The sensor
              enabled the operators to objectively note and evaluate the
              insertion force and better cooperative handling was possible.
              Additionally, other members of the intervention team shared the
              information. Force records demonstrated the characteristic
              patterns according to every stage of coiling (framing, filling,
              and finishing). CONCLUSIONS: The force sensor system adequately
              measured coil insertion force in intracranial aneurysm coil
              embolization procedures. The safety of this sensor was
              demonstrated in clinical application for the limited number of
              patients. This system is useful adjunct for assisting during coil
              embolization for an intracranial aneurysm.",

              heart disease. In industrialized countries, the prevalence of
              valvular heart disease is estimated at 2.5\%. Because of the
              predominance of degenerative etiologies, the prevalence of
              valvular disease increases markedly after the age of 65 years, in
              particular with regard to aortic stenosis and mitral
              regurgitation, which accounts for 3 in 4 cases of valvular
              disease. Rheumatic heart disease still represents 22\% of
              valvular heart disease in Europe. The prevalence of secondary
              mitral regurgitation cannot be assessed reliably but it seems to
              be a frequent disease. The incidence of infective endocarditis is
              approximately 30 cases per million individiuals per year. Its
              stability is associated with marked changes in its presentation.
              Patients are getting older and staphylococcus is now becoming the
              microorganism most frequently responsible. Heath care-associated
              infections are the most likely explanation of changes in the
              microbiology of infective endocarditis. In developing countries,
              rheumatic heart disease remains the leading cause of valvular
              heart disease. Its prevalence is high, between 20 and 30 cases
              per 1000 subjects when using systematic echocardiographic
              screening. In conclusion, the temporal and geographical
              heterogeneity illustrates the effect of socioeconomic status and
              changes in life expectancy on the frequency and presentation of
              valvular heart disease. A decreased burden of valvular disease

              72-year-old man with end-stage lung disease who received a left
              single lung transplant. On postoperative day 54, he was evaluated
              for recurrent dyspnea on exertion that was due to a severe
              stenosis at the site of the pulmonary artery anastomosis. Balloon
              angioplasty was performed, and a 10-mm stent was deployed, with
              marked clinical improvement. Fourteen months later, he presented
              with recurrent symptoms due to in-stent restenosis. Multiple
              attempts at catheterization and balloon angioplasty of the stent
              failed. Due to the technical difficulty involved in maneuvering
              the balloon while maintaining stability, it was decided to repeat
              the angioplasty with the assistance of a Hansen Sensei remote

              robotic-assisted percutaneous coronary intervention. BACKGROUND:
              Robotic systems have been suggested to enhance the performance of
              cardiovascular procedures, as well as to provide protection from
              the occupational hazards that are associated with interventional
              practice. METHODS: Patients with coronary artery disease and
              clinical indications for percutaneous intervention were enrolled.
              The coronary intervention was performed with the CorPath 200
              robotic system, which consists of a remote interventional cockpit
              and a bedside disposable cassette that enables the operator to
              advance, retract, and rotate guidewires and catheters. The
              primary endpoints were clinical procedural success, defined as
              <30\% residual stenosis at the completion of the robotic-assisted
              procedure without major adverse cardiovascular events within 30
              days, and device technical success, defined as the successful
              manipulation of the intracoronary devices using the robotic
              system only. RESULTS: A total of 164 patients were enrolled at 9
              sites. Percutaneous coronary intervention was completed
              successfully without conversion to manual operation, and device
              technical success was achieved in 162 of 164 patients (98.8\%).
              There were no device-related complications. Clinical procedural
              success was achieved in 160 of 164 patients (97.6\%), whereas 4
              (2.4\%) had periprocedural non-Q-wave myocardial infarctions. No
              deaths, strokes, Q-wave myocardial infarctions, or
              revascularization occurred in the 30 days after the procedures.
              Radiation exposure for the primary operator was 95.2\% lower than
              the levels found at the traditional table position. CONCLUSIONS:
              This pivotal multicenter study with a robotic-enhanced coronary
              intervention system demonstrated the safety and feasibility of
              the system. The robotic remote-control procedure met the expected

              negatively impacted by inaccurate lesion measurement and
              inappropriate stent length selection (SLS). We compared visual
              estimate of these parameters to those provided by the CorPath
              200\textregistered{} Robotic PCI System. METHODS: Sixty
              consecutive patients who underwent coronary stent placement
              utilizing the CorPath System were evaluated. The treating
              physician assessed orthogonal images and provided visual
              estimates of lesion length and SLS. The robotic system was then
              used for the same measures. SLS was considered to be accurate
              when visual estimate and robotic measures were in agreement.
              Visual estimate SLSs were considered to be ``short'' or ``long''
              if they were below or above the robotic-selected stents,
              respectively. RESULTS: Only 35\% (21/60) of visually estimated
              lesions resulted in accurate SLS, whereas 33\% (20/60) and 32\%
              (19/60) of the visually estimated SLSs were long and short,

              on the robotic lesion measurement being shorter than the visual
              estimate. CONCLUSIONS: Visual estimate assessment of lesion
              length and SLS is highly variable with 65\% of the cases being
              inaccurately measured when compared to objective measures
              obtained from the robotic system. The 32\% of the cases where
              lesions were visually estimated to be short represents cases that
              often require the use of extra stents after the full lesion is
              not covered by 1 stent [longitudinal geographic miss (LGM)].
              Further, these data showed that the use of the robotic system
              prevented the use of extra stents in 8.3\% of the cases.

              exposure during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
              METHODS: Real-time radiation exposure data were prospectively
              collected from dosimeters worn by operating physicians at the
              head- and chest-level during consecutive PCI cases. Exposures
              were compared in three study groups: 1) manual PCI performed with
              traditional lead apparel; 2) manual PCI performed using suspended
              lead; and 3) robotic PCI performed in combination with suspended
              lead. RESULTS: Among 336 cases (86.6\% manual, 13.4\% robotic)
              performed over 30weeks, use of suspended lead during manual PCI
              was associated with significantly less radiation exposure to the
              chest and head of operating physicians than traditional lead
              apparel (chest: 0.0 [0.1] $\mu$Sv vs 0.4 [4.0] $\mu$Sv, p<0.001;
              head: 0.5 [1.9] $\mu$Sv vs 14.9 [51.5] $\mu$Sv, p<0.001).
              Chest-level radiation exposure during robotic PCI performed in
              combination with suspended lead was 0.0 [0.0] $\mu$Sv, which was
              significantly less chest exposure than manual PCI performed with
              traditional lead (p<0.001) or suspended lead (p=0.046). In
              robotic PCI the median head-level exposure was 0.1 [0.2] $\mu$Sv,
              which was 99.3\% less than manual PCI performed with traditional
              lead (p<0.001) and 80.0\% less than manual PCI performed with

  abstract = "Objectives The objectives of this study were to evaluate the
              ability of interventional cardiologists to accurately measure
              lesion length and select appropriate stents. Background
              Inaccurate measurement of lesion length during percutaneous
              coronary intervention (PCI) increases the risk of restenosis.
              Methods Interventional cardiologists (n?=?40) evaluated 25
              matched orthogonal angiographic images that were prescored using
              quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) by a core laboratory.
              Visual estimates of lesion length and stent length selection were
              compared to the maximum QCA value. A 2?4 mm stent overlap of both
              the proximal and distal lesion edges was considered to be
              optimal. Based on optimal stent overlap, accurate lesion lengths
              were those measured from ?1 to +4 mm from the QCA. Likewise,
              appropriate stent lengths were those that measured between +4 mm
              to +8 mm from the QCA value. Five images were repeated to assess
              intrarater variability. Results Lesion length measurements were
              short and long for 51.1\% (95\% CI 47.6?54.6\%) and 19.0\% (95\%
              CI 16.3?21.9\%) of the images, respectively. Stent length
              selections that were short and long were recorded for 55.0\%
              (95\% CI 51.5?58.5\%) and 22.8\% (95\% CI 19.9?25.8\%) of the
              images, respectively. Intrarater variability evaluation indicated
              that 38.5\% (95\% CI 31.7?45.6\%) of lesion length measurements
              and 37.5\% (95\% CI 30.8?44.6\%) of stent length selections were
              >3 mm different between the first and second evaluation of
              repeated images. Conclusions Visual estimation of coronary lesion
              length has a high degree of variability, which may lead to
              inappropriate stent selection. Improving the accuracy of lesion
              length measurement may improve patient outcomes. ? 2015 Wiley

              remote-control, robotic-assisted angioplasty system is under
              development to address some of the procedural challenges and
              occupational hazards associated with traditional PCI. METHODS:
              Patients with coronary artery disease and clinical indication for
              elective PCI were enrolled. The coronary angioplasty procedure
              was performed with the CorPath 200 robotic system (Corindus,
              Inc., Natick, Massachusetts). The system consists of a remote
              interventional cockpit and a multicomponent bedside unit that
              enables the operator to advance, retract, and rotate guidewires
              and rapid exchange catheters. The primary endpoint was device
              clinical success ($\leq$ 30\% residual stenosis) without
              in-hospital major adverse cardiac events. Technical success was
              defined as the ability of the system to complete all the planned
              angioplasty steps on the basis of procedural segments. Patients
              were followed up to 30 days after angioplasty procedure. RESULTS:
              A total of 8 patients were enrolled in the study. The primary
              endpoint was achieved in all patients (100\%). The technical
              success of the robotic system was 97.9\% in completing 47 of 48
              planned steps. There were no device- or procedure-related
              complications and no in-hospital or 30-day major adverse cardiac
              events. The operators rated the robotic system performances as
              equal to or better than manual procedures in 97.5\% of the cases.
              The operator radiation exposure was 97\% lower than the levels
              found at the standard table position. CONCLUSIONS: Early clinical
              experience with a robotic-assisted angioplasty system
              demonstrated feasibility, safety, and procedural effectiveness

              Israel) in which the angioplasty guidewire, the balloon, and the
              stent are navigated via a computerized system. BACKGROUND:
              Percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) are manually performed
              under fluoroscopic guidance, requiring lead protection for the
              operators. A system in which the operator can remotely, safely,
              and precisely navigate the procedure during PCI would have clear
              advantages. METHODS: The RNS involves a computer-controlled wire
              and delivery system navigator. Following preclinical validation,
              the system was assessed in patients undergoing single-vessel PCI.
              RESULTS: The study involved 18 patients (age 55.9 years, 16\%
              women). The RNS successfully crossed lesions with the guidewire
              in 17 patients. The stent was then advanced by the advance/rotate
              mode and adequately positioned in 15 of 17 cases. Technical
              malfunction was encountered in three patients in whom the
              procedure was successfully completed manually. Direct stenting
              was employed in 10 of 18 patients, pre-dilation in 7 patients,
              and after-stent balloon dilation in 5 patients. The total
              fluoroscopy time for 17 RNS patients was compared with the
              corresponding time of 20 consecutive patients who underwent
              standard single-lesion PCI. Fluoroscopy time was similar for both
              procedures, with 8.8 +/- 4.8 min with the RNS versus 9.1 +/- 3.5
              min with the standard techniques (p = NS). Clinical success was
              100\% and technical success 94\% for the guidewire and 83\% for
              the overall procedure. CONCLUSIONS: The use of the RNS for
              guidewire, balloon, and stent manipulation during PCI appears
              safe and feasible for the treatment of patients with coronary

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Acute ischemic stroke is a potentially
              devastating condition and leading cause of morbidity and
              mortality, affecting an estimated 800 000 people per year in the
              USA. The natural history of untreated or unrevascularized large
              vessel occlusions in acute stroke patients results in mortality
              rates approaching 30\%, with only 25\% achieving good neurologic
              outcomes at 90 days. Recently, data have demonstrated that early
              endovascular recanalization of large vessel occlusions results in
              better outcomes than medical therapy alone. However, the majority
              of patients in these studies were treated with a stent retriever
              based approach. The purpose of COMPASS is to evaluate whether
              patients treated with a direct aspiration first pass (ADAPT)
              approach have non-inferior functional outcomes to those treated
              with a stent retriever as the firstline (SRFL) approach.
              MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients who meet the inclusion and
              exclusion criteria and consent to participate will be enrolled at
              participating centers. Treatment will be randomly assigned by a
              central web based system in a 1:1 manner to treatment with either
              ADAPT or SRFL thrombectomy. Statistical methodology is
              prespecified with details available in the statistical analysis

              collection/verification is ongoing. The final results will be
              made available on completion of enrollment and follow-up.

              device that was specifically designed to retrieve resistant
              fibrin rich clots, the geometric clot extractor (GCE; Neuravi,
              Galway, Ireland), in an in vitro cerebrovascular occlusion stroke
              model. METHODS: After introducing fibrin rich clot analogues into
              the middle cerebral artery of the model, we compared the rates of
              recanalization between GCE and Solitaire flow restoration stent
              retriever (SR; Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA; control
              group) cases. A maximum of three passes of each device was
              allowed. If the SR failed to recanalize the vessel after three
              passes, one pass of the GCE was allowed (rescue cases). RESULTS:
              In a total of 26 thrombectomy cases (13 GCE, 13 SR), successful
              recanalization (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score of 2b
              or 3) was achieved 100\% of the time in the GCE cases with an
              average of 2.13 passes per case. This rate was significantly
              higher compared with the Solitaire recanalization rate (7.7\%,
              P<0.0001) with an average of three passes per case. After SR
              failure (in 92\% of cases), successful one pass GCE rescue

              manual assistance or manual conversion during R-PCI in clinical
              practice. METHODS: The CorPath 200 System (Corindus, Waltham, MA)
              enables the operator to sit in a radiation-shielded cockpit and
              remotely control intracoronary devices including guidewires,
              balloons, and stents. Consecutive R-PCI procedures performed over
              18months were analyzed to identify reasons for planned or
              unplanned manual assistance or manual conversion, and categorized
              as due to 1) adverse event; 2) technical limitation of the
              robotic platform; or 3) limited guide catheter/wire support.
              RESULTS: During the study period, 108 R-PCI procedures
              (68.1$\pm$11.0years, 77.8\% men, 69.4\% elective PCI, 78.3\% type
              B2/C lesions, and 50.3\% left anterior descending/left main
              target lesion segment) were performed. High robotic technical
              success (91.7\%) and clinical procedural success (99.1\%) were
              achieved. Twenty procedures (18.5\%) required either planned
              partial manual assistance (3.7\%), unplanned partial manual
              assistance (7.4\%), or manual conversion (7.4\%). Among these
              procedures, manual assistance/conversion was required in 3

              limitation of the robotic platform (40\%), and 9 for guide

              success with R-PCI for a complex lesion cohort is possible with
              only occasional partial manual assistance or manual conversion.
              The majority of procedures requiring manual assistance/conversion

              Background The safety and feasibility of RA?PCI has been
              established in preclinical animal trials and human clinical
              trials. Patients with LGM have been shown to have worse clinical
              outcomes including significantly increased incidences of MACE.
              Methods Patients with significant coronary artery disease
              underwent RA?PCI in the PRECISE study (n=164) and standard M?PCI
              in the STLLR trial (n?=?1,509). Longitudinal geographic miss was
              defined as cases where the entire length of the injured or
              stenotic segment was not fully covered by the total length of the
              stent. The incidence of LGM was compared between RA?PCI and M?PCI
              cohorts. Results The RA?PCI cohort had a significantly greater
              prevalence of previous MI, previous coronary revascularization,
              and unstable angina. The robotic cohort exhibited a lower
              incidence of LGM when compared to the M?PCI patients, 12.2\% to
              43.1\%, respectively (P?<?0.0001). To account for the differences
              in baseline characteristics between the two studies, a propensity
              score analysis was conducted. The propensity modeling showed
              similar rates of LGM in both a larger group of patients that met
              key PRECISE study inclusion/exclusion criteria adjusted for
              propensity score (9.3\% vs 55.0\%; P?<?0.0001) and in a smaller,
              matched on propensity score, subset of patients (10.3\% vs
              64.1\%; P?<?0.0001). Conclusion Robotic?assisted PCI had
              significantly lower incidence of LGM compared to standard M?PCI.
              Reducing LGM potentially improves long?term clinical outcomes

              to address limitations of current bronchoscopic techniques for
              biopsy of suspected peripheral lung lesions. This study sought to
              evaluate complications and feasibility of robotic bronchoscopy
              performed with the Robotic Endoscopy System (RES). METHODS: Adult
              patients from a single institution underwent bronchoscopy of
              suspected lesions with a bronchus sign with the RES. The primary
              outcome was complication rate, as assessed by the incidence of
              related serious adverse events (SAE). The secondary outcome was
              technical feasibility. Data are presented as median (range),
              counts, and percentage. P-value was calculated using the
              Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Of 17 screened patients, 15 were
              eligible. The median age was 67 (38 to 79) years. The lesions (12
              peripheral and 3 central) were located in the right lower lobe
              (33\%), right upper lobe (27\%), left upper lobe (27\%), and left
              lower lobe (13\%). No SAE, including pneumothorax and significant
              bleeding, occurred. Biopsy samples were obtained from 93\% of
              patients. One sampling (right upper lobe) required conventional
              bronchoscopy and another required surgery to confirm malignancy.
              Cancer was confirmed in 60\% (9/15) of patients. Benign features
              were found in 5 of 6 patients. Time to biopsy location reduced
              from 45 (21 to 84) minutes (first 5 cases) to 20 (7 to 47)
              minutes (last 9 cases), P=0.039. CONCLUSIONS: The study results
              and absence of SAE support feasibility of the RES in accessing
              the periphery of the lung. The RES has potential to address
              challenges associated with biopsy of peripheral lung lesions.This

              functional outcomes for the diaphyseal fractures of long bones.
              However, locking the distal holes of the IMN is challenging.
              Although several navigation methods have been proposed, an
              intuitive, radiation-free and accurate navigation method that
              does not suffer from problems of hand-eye coordination has not

              electromagnetic (EM) tracking for distal IMN interlocking. Model
              experiments are designed to evaluate the AR-guided distal
              interlocking method. RESULTS: AR-guided drilling procedures were
              performed on 5 tibia models and a leg phantom. The accuracy (hit
              or miss) was evaluated using fluoroscopy. The experimental
              results demonstrated that all 18 drills successfully hit the
              distal holes at a rate of 100\%. CONCLUSIONS: Our results
              indicate that the AR-guided distal interlocking method is

  abstract = "Fast and accurate diagnosis of stroke is crucial for the
              immediate application of the right therapy to patients. However,
              rapid diagnosis is still a challenge since an ischemic stroke
              cannot be identified based only on clinical assessment. CT or MRI
              imaging is required to rule out hemorrhagic stroke since
              thrombolytic therapy can lead to increased intracranial bleeding
              and further aggravation of hemorrhagic stroke. In addition,
              clinical situations that imitate the signs and symptoms of stroke
              may also impede the rapid diagnosis and treatment of stroke
              victims. It is therefore of value to discover non-invasive tests
              that aim to quickly distinguish stroke from stroke mimics and
              distinguish ischemic from hemorrhagic stroke. Identifying blood
              biomarkers of stroke is an active area of research since their
              potential use is not limited to diagnosis and differentiation,
              but can be applied to prognosis and patient monitoring -
              monitoring the effectiveness of applied therapy and/or diagnose
              possible complications. However, their use has been limited so
              far not only for reasons related to patients and the disease
              (heterogeneity of stroke etiology, the complexity of the ischemic
              cascade, the impact of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) on diffusion
              of blood biomarkers, and difficulties in obtaining consent from
              stroke patients) but also for reasons that related to laboratory
              measurement of these biomarkers (pre-analytical and analytical
              issues as well as interpretation of laboratory measurements).
              Until today, many biomarkers have been identified, however none
              so far have shown sufficient sensitivity and specificity in order
              to be used in the clinical setting. In this review, we will focus
              on ischemic stroke and we aim to highlight these problems and
              also investigate if these are due to stroke complexity or due to
              our limited knowledge of pre-analytical requirements for many of

              and standing hand/ arm tasks. The new system provides support for
              both horizontal and vertical arm motion. A total of 11
              participants performed ten tasks (five seated and five standing)
              both with and without the arm support. Outcomes were assessed
              with electromyography and subjective feedback. Muscle activity
              was measured over the dominant side supraspinatus, triceps and
              forearm extensor muscles. Significant (p < 0.01) reductions in
              static muscle activity were observed in one of ten tasks

              independence when a personal care attendant is not available on
              site. PerMMA integrates both a smart powered wheelchair and two
              dexterous robotic arms to assist its users in completing
              essential mobility and manipulation tasks during basic and
              instrumental activities of daily living (ADL). Two user
              interfaces were developed: a local control interface and a remote
              operator controller. This paper reports on the evaluation of
              PerMMA with end users completing basic ADL tasks. Participants
              with both lower and upper extremity impairments (N=15) were
              recruited to operate PerMMA and complete up to five ADL tasks in
              a single session of no more than two hours (to avoid fatigue or
              frustration of the participants). The performance of PerMMA was
              evaluated by participants completing ADL tasks with two different
              control modes: local mode and cooperative control. The users'
              task completion performance and answers on pre/post-evaluation
              questionnaires demonstrated not only the ease in learning and
              usefulness of PerMMA, but also their attitudes toward assistance
              from advanced technology like PerMMA. As a part of the iterative
              development process, results of this work will serve as
              supporting evidence to identify design criteria and other areas
              for improvement of PerMMA.",

              MATERIALS AND METHODS: An open, multicentre, controlled study. We

              evaluated in three multi-step scenarios: selection of the room in
              which the object to be retrieved was located (in the presence or

              three nine-degree-of-freedom (9-DOF) inertial measurement units

              short-term impacts on new users. Therefore, this study aims to
              document the long-term impacts of this assistive device on users
              and their family caregivers following prolonged use. METHODS:
              Users' characteristics, caregivers' characteristics and expenses
              related to JACO were documented with questionnaires designed for
              this study. Upper extremity performance was measured with an
              adaptation of an upper extremity performance test, the TEMPA, and
              accomplishment of life habits was documented in an interview
              based on the LIFE-H questionnaire. Satisfaction with JACO and
              psychosocial impacts of its use were measured with validated
              questionnaires, namely the QUEST and the PIADS-10. Impacts of
              JACO on family caregivers were documented with a validated
              questionnaire, the CATOM. Descriptive statistics were used to
              report the results. RESULTS: Seven users and five caregivers were
              recruited. One user had expenses related to JACO in the past two
              months. Users had a better upper extremity performance with JACO
              than without it and they used their robotic arm to accomplish
              certain life habits. Most users were satisfied with JACO and the
              psychosocial impacts were positive. Impacts on family caregivers
              were slight. CONCLUSIONS: JACO increased performance in
              manipulation and facilitated the accomplishment of certain life
              habits. Users' increased participation in their life habits may
              slightly decrease the amount of caregiver assistance required.
              Future studies are needed to clarify its economic potential, its
              impact on caregivers' burden, including paid caregivers, and the
              variability in the tasks performed using JACO. Implications for

              users in terms of upper extremity performance, accomplishment of
              life habits, satisfaction with the device and psychosocial
              impacts. More research is needed to quantify more accurately the

              assessment of the impact of timeliness of care and
              multidisciplinary teams on outcome. METHODS: The applicable
              current medical literature was identified by a computerized
              search and evaluated using standardized methods. Recommendations
              were framed using the approach described by the Guidelines
              Oversight Committee of the American College of Chest Physicians.
              Data sources included MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database of
              Systematic Reviews. RESULTS: Initial evaluation should include a
              thorough history and physical examination; CT imaging; pulmonary
              function tests; and hemoglobin, electrolyte, liver function, and
              calcium levels. Additional testing for distant metastases and
              paraneoplastic syndromes should be determined on the basis of
              these results. Paraneoplastic syndromes may have an adverse
              impact on cancer treatment, so they should be controlled rapidly
              with the goal of proceeding with definitive cancer treatment in a
              timely manner. Although the relationship between timeliness of
              care and survival is difficult to quantify, efforts to deliver
              timely care are reasonable and should be balanced with the need
              to attend to other dimensions of health-care quality (eg, safety,
              effectiveness, efficiency, equality, consistency with patient
              values and preferences). Quality care will require multiple
              disciplines. Although it is difficult to assess the impact, we
              suggest that a multidisciplinary team approach to care be used,
              particularly for patients requiring multimodality therapy.
              CONCLUSIONS: The initial evaluation of patients with lung cancer
              should include a thorough history and physical examination,
              pulmonary function tests, CT imaging, basic laboratory tests, and
              selective testing for distant metastases and paraneoplastic
              syndromes.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Correctly staging lung cancer is important because
              the treatment options and prognosis differ significantly by
              stage. Several noninvasive imaging studies and invasive tests are
              available. Understanding the accuracy, advantages, and
              disadvantages of the available methods for staging non-small cell
              lung cancer is critical to decision-making. METHODS: Test
              accuracies for the available staging studies were updated from
              the second iteration of the American College of Chest Physicians
              Lung Cancer Guidelines. Systematic searches of the MEDLINE
              database were performed up to June 2012 with the inclusion of
              selected meta-analyses, practice guidelines, and reviews. Study
              designs and results are summarized in evidence tables. RESULTS:
              The sensitivity and specificity of CT scanning for identifying
              mediastinal lymph node metastasis were approximately 55\% and
              81\%, respectively, confirming that CT scanning has limited
              ability either to rule in or exclude mediastinal metastasis. For
              PET scanning, estimates of sensitivity and specificity for
              identifying mediastinal metastasis were approximately 77\% and
              86\%, respectively. These findings demonstrate that PET scanning
              is more accurate than CT scanning, but tissue biopsy is still
              required to confirm PET scan findings. The needle techniques
              endobronchial ultrasound-needle aspiration, endoscopic
              ultrasound-needle aspiration, and combined endobronchial
              ultrasound/endoscopic ultrasound-needle aspiration have
              sensitivities of approximately 89\%, 89\%, and 91\%,
              respectively. In direct comparison with surgical staging, needle
              techniques have emerged as the best first diagnostic tools to
              obtain tissue. Based on randomized controlled trials, PET or
              PET-CT scanning is recommended for staging and to detect
              unsuspected metastatic disease and avoid noncurative resections.
              CONCLUSIONS: Since the last iteration of the staging guidelines,
              PET scanning has assumed a more prominent role both in its use
              prior to surgery and when evaluating for metastatic disease.
              Minimally invasive needle techniques to stage the mediastinum
              have become increasingly accepted and are the tests of first
              choice to confirm mediastinal disease in accessible lymph node
              stations. If negative, these needle techniques should be followed
              by surgical biopsy. All abnormal scans should be confirmed by
              tissue biopsy (by whatever method is available) to ensure
              accurate staging. Evidence suggests that more complete staging
              improves patient outcomes.",

              increasingly used for diagnosing pulmonary lesions. Reported
              yield from these procedures varies widely with few randomized
              clinical trials. This study compares the diagnostic yield of a
              thin bronchoscope and radial endobronchial ultrasound (R-EBUS) to
              standard bronchoscopy with fluoroscopy (SB-F) in lung lesions.
              METHODS: Patients presenting for diagnostic bronchoscopic
              evaluation at five centers were randomized to undergo SB-F or
              R-EBUS with thin bronchoscope (TB-EBUS). If SB-F was
              non-diagnostic, cross over to TB-EBUS arm was allowed. Patient
              demographics, radiographic features, and final pathologic or
              radiographic follow-up were collected. Statistical comparisons
              were made using Fisher square, chi-square tests and t-test.
              Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine
              predictors of diagnostic yield. RESULTS: A total of 197 patients
              were included in the final analyses. There was no difference in
              demographics, lesion size, or location between study arms. The
              average lesion size was 31.2mm (SD 10.8mm). Bronchoscopy was
              diagnostic in 44\% (n=87) of cases. Although the diagnostic yield
              was higher in the TB-EBUS arm when compared to the SB-F arm (49\%
              vs 37\%), this difference was not statistically significant
              (p=0.11). Among those with non-diagnostic bronchoscopic findings
              in the standard arm, 87\% (n=46) crossed over to TB-EBUS,
              resulting in a diagnosis in 7 (15\% of 46) additional patients.
              CONCLUSIONS: Bronchoscopy with or without a thin scope and R-EBUS
              had a poor diagnostic yield for pulmonary lesions. Future work
              should focus on improvements in technique and technology advances
              that ensure a higher likelihood of obtaining a diagnosis.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Because pulmonary nodules are found in up to 25\% of
              patients undergoing computed tomography of the chest, the
              question of whether to perform biopsy is becoming increasingly
              common. Data on complications after transthoracic needle lung
              biopsy are limited to case series from selected institutions.
              OBJECTIVE: To determine population-based estimates of risks for
              complications after transthoracic needle biopsy of a pulmonary
              nodule. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis. SETTING: The 2006 State
              Ambulatory Surgery Databases and State Inpatient Databases for
              California, Florida, Michigan, and New York from the Healthcare
              Cost and Utilization Project. PATIENTS: 15 865 adults who had
              transthoracic needle biopsy of a pulmonary nodule. MEASUREMENTS:
              Percentage of biopsies complicated by hemorrhage, any
              pneumothorax, or pneumothorax requiring a chest tube, and
              adjusted odds ratios for these complications associated with
              various biopsy characteristics, calculated by using multivariate,
              population-averaged generalized estimating equations. RESULTS:
              Although hemorrhage was rare, complicating 1.0\% (95\% CI, 0.9\%
              to 1.2\%) of biopsies, 17.8\% (CI, 11.8\% to 23.8\%) of patients
              with hemorrhage required a blood transfusion. In contrast, the
              risk for any pneumothorax was 15.0\% (CI, 14.0\% to 16.0\%), and
              6.6\% (CI, 6.0\% to 7.2\%) of all biopsies resulted in
              pneumothorax requiring a chest tube. Compared with patients
              without complications, those who experienced hemorrhage or
              pneumothorax requiring a chest tube had longer lengths of stay (P
              < 0.001) and were more likely to develop respiratory failure
              requiring mechanical ventilation (P = 0.020). Patients aged 60 to
              69 years (as opposed to younger or older patients), smokers, and
              those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease had higher risk
              for complications. LIMITATIONS: Estimated risks may be inaccurate
              if coding of complications is incomplete. The analyzed databases
              contain little clinical detail (such as information on nodule
              characteristics or biopsy pathology) and cannot indicate whether
              performing the biopsy produced useful information. CONCLUSION:
              Whereas hemorrhage is an infrequent complication of transthoracic
              needle lung biopsy, pneumothorax is common and often necessitates
              chest tube placement. These population-based data should help
              patients and physicians make more informed choices about whether
              to perform biopsy of a pulmonary nodule. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE:

              technologies have been developed, but their clinical
              effectiveness and determinants of diagnostic yield have not been
              quantified. Prospective data are needed to determine
              risk-adjusted diagnostic yield. METHODS: We prospectively
              enrolled patients undergoing TBNA of mediastinal lymph nodes in
              the American College of Chest Physicians Quality Improvement
              Registry, Evaluation, and Education (AQuIRE) multicenter database
              and recorded clinical, procedural, and provider information. All
              clinical decisions, including type of TBNA used (conventional vs
              endobronchial ultrasound-guided), were made by the attending
              bronchoscopist. The primary outcome was obtaining a specific
              diagnosis. RESULTS: We enrolled 891 patients at six hospitals.
              Most procedures (95\%) were performed with ultrasound guidance. A
              specific diagnosis was made in 447 cases. Unadjusted diagnostic
              yields were 37\% to 54\% for different hospitals, with
              significant between-hospital heterogeneity (P = .0001).
              Diagnostic yield was associated with annual hospital TBNA volume
              (OR, 1.003; 95\% CI, 1.000-1.006; P = .037), smoking (OR, 1.55;
              95\% CI, 1.02-2.34; P = .042), biopsy of more than two sites (OR,
              0.57; 95\% CI, 0.38-0.85; P = .015), lymph node size (reference >
              1-2 cm, $\leq$ 1 cm: OR, 0.51; 95\% CI, 0.34-0.77; P = .003; >
              2-3 cm: OR, 2.49; 95\% CI, 1.61-3.85; P 3 cm: OR, 3.61; 95\% CI,
              2.17-6.00; P < .001), and positive PET scan (OR, 3.12; 95\% CI,
              1.39-7.01; P = .018). Biopsy was performed on more and smaller
              nodes at high-volume hospitals (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: To our
              knowledge, this is the first bronchoscopy study of risk-adjusted
              diagnostic yields on a hospital-level basis. High-volume
              hospitals were associated with high diagnostic yields. This study

              decrease the invasiveness of pedicle screw placement in spine
              surgery has led to a markedly increased interest in robotic
              technology. The SpineAssist from Mazor is one of the most widely
              distributed robotic systems. The aim of this study was to compare
              the accuracy of robot-guided and conventional freehand
              fluoroscopy-guided pedicle screw placement in thoracolumbar
              surgery. METHODS This study is a retrospective series of 169
              patients (83 women [49\%]) who underwent placement of pedicle
              screw instrumentation from 2007 to 2015 in 2 reference centers.
              Pathological entities included degenerative disorders, tumors,
              and traumatic cases. In the robot-assisted cohort (98 patients,
              439 screws), pedicle screws were inserted with robotic
              assistance. In the freehand fluoroscopy-guided cohort (71
              patients, 441 screws), screws were inserted using anatomical
              landmarks and lateral fluoroscopic guidance. Patients treated
              before 2009 were included in the fluoroscopy cohort, whereas
              those treated since mid-2009 (when the robot was acquired) were
              included in the robot cohort. Since then, the decision to operate
              using robotic assistance or conventional freehand technique has
              been based on surgeon preference and logistics. The accuracy of
              screw placement was assessed based on the Gertzbein-Robbins scale
              by a neuroradiologist blinded to treatment group. The
              radiological slice with the largest visible deviation from the
              pedicle was chosen for grading. A pedicle breach of 2 mm or less
              was deemed acceptable (Grades A and B) while deviations greater
              than 2 mm (Grades C, D, and E) were classified as misplacements.
              RESULTS In the robot-assisted cohort, a perfect trajectory (Grade
              A) was observed for 366 screws (83.4\%). The remaining screws
              were Grades B (n = 44 [10\%]), C (n = 15 [3.4\%]), D (n = 8
              [1.8\%]), and E (n = 6 [1.4\%]). In the fluoroscopy-guided group,
              a completely intrapedicular course graded as A was found in 76\%
              (n = 335). The remaining screws were Grades B (n = 57 [12.9\%]),
              C (n = 29 [6.6\%]), D (n = 12 [2.7\%]), and E (n = 8 [1.8\%]).
              The proportion of non-misplaced screws (corresponding to
              Gertzbein-Robbins Grades A and B) was higher in the
              robot-assisted group (93.4\%) than the freehand fluoroscopy group
              (88.9\%) (p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS The authors' retrospective case
              review found that robot-guided pedicle screw placement is a safe,
              useful, and potentially more accurate alternative to the
              conventional freehand technique for the placement of

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Many retrospective studies of pedicle screw placement
              have revealed that intraoperative navigation systems provide
              higher accuracy rates and safety than do free-hand techniques.
              The accuracy of various image-guided navigation systems has been
              studied; however, differences have not been well defined due to
              the lack of adequate evidence-based comparative studies.
              OBJECTIVE: A meta-analysis was conducted to focus on the
              variation in pedicle screw insertion among 3 navigation systems:
              a 3-dimensional fluoroscopy-based navigation system (3D
              FluoroNav), a 2-dimensional fluoroscopy-based navigation system
              (2D FluoroNav), and a conventional computed tomography navigation
              system (CT Nav). METHODS: We screened for comparative studies on
              different pedicle screw insertion navigation systems published
              through January 2017 using the Cochrane Library, Ovid, Web of
              Science, PubMed, and EMBASE databases. RESULTS: From 125 papers
              that were identified, 10 articles were finally chosen. The
              present comparative study included 8 retrospective clinical
              studies, 1 prospective clinical trial, and 1 randomized
              controlled cadaveric study. The prevalence rate of pedicle
              violation in the 3D FluoroNav group was significantly lower than
              the rates of the 2D FluoroNav group (relative risk [RR] 95\%,
              confidence interval [CI]: 0.16-0.61, P < 0.01) and the CT Nav
              group (RR 95\%, CI: 0.42-0.90, P = 0.01), and the rate of the CT
              Nav group was significantly lower than that of the 2D FluoroNav
              group (RR 95\%, CI: 0.29-0.81, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Significant
              differences exist among CT Nav, 3D FluoroNav, and 2D FluoroNav.
              Our review suggests that 3D FluoroNav may be superior to the
              other 2 methods in reducing pedicle violation and that clinicians
              should consider 3D FluoroNav as a better choice.",

              electronic databases of PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of
              Science were searched for the literatures published up to
              January, 2016. Statistical analysis was performed using the

              [Formula: see text]. RESULTS: A total of 257 patients and 1105
              screws were included in the five studies for this meta-analysis.
              The results revealed that there was no difference in the accuracy

              evaluate the accuracy, the operative time consumption, the amount
              of intraoperative blood loss, time of pedicle insertion and the
              incidence of complications of thoracic pedicle screw placement in
              patients with thoracic diseases such as scoliosis and kyphosis.
              Pubmed, Web of Knowledge, and Google scholar were searched to
              identify comparative studies of thoracic pedicle screw placement
              between intraoperative computer navigation and fluoroscopy-guided
              navigation. Outcomes of malposition rate, operative time
              consumption, insertion time, intraoperative blood loss, and the
              incidence of complications are evaluated. Fourteen articles
              including 1723 patients and 9019 PSs were identified matching
              inclusion criteria. The malposition rate was lower (RR: 0.33, 95
              \% CI: 0.28-0.38, P < 0.01) in computer navigation group than
              that in fluoroscopy-guided navigation group; the operative time
              was significantly longer [weighted mean difference (WMD) = 23.66,
              95 \% CI: 14.74-32.57, P < 0.01] in computer navigation group
              than that in fluoroscopy-guided navigation group. The time of
              insertion was shorter (WMD = -1.88, 95 \% CI: -2.25- -1.52, P <
              0.01) in computer navigation group than that in
              fluoroscopy-guided navigation group. The incidence of
              complications was lower (RR = 0. 23, 95 \% CI: 0.12-0.46, P <
              0.01) in computer navigation group than that in the other group.
              The intraoperative blood loss was fewer (WMD = -167.49, 95 \% CI:
              -266.39- -68.58, P < 0.01) in computer navigation group than that
              in the other. In conclusion, the meta-analysis of thoracic
              pedicle screw placement studies clearly demonstrated lower
              malposition rate, less intraoperative blood loss, and fewer
              complications when using computer navigation. This result

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: In the airline industry, training is costly and
              operator error must be avoided. Therefore, virtual reality (VR)
              is routinely used to learn manual and technical skills through
              simulation before pilots assume flight responsibilities. In the
              field of medicine, manual and technical skills must also be
              acquired to competently perform invasive procedures such as
              flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FFB). Until recently, training
              in FFB and other endoscopic procedures has occurred on the job in
              real patients. We hypothesized that novice trainees using a VR
              skill center could rapidly acquire basic skills, and that results
              would compare favorably with those of senior trainees trained in
              the conventional manner. METHODS: We prospectively studied five
              novice bronchoscopists entering a pulmonary and critical care
              medicine training program. They were taught to perform inspection
              flexible bronchoscopy using a VR bronchoscopy skill center;
              dexterity, speed, and accuracy were tested using the skill center
              and an inanimate airway model before and after 4 h of group
              instruction and 4 h of individual unsupervised practice. Results
              were compared to those of a control group of four skilled
              physicians who had performed at least 200 bronchoscopies during 2
              years of training. Student's t tests were used to compare mean
              scores of study and control groups for the inanimate model and VR
              bronchoscopy simulator. Before-training and after-training test
              scores were compared using paired t tests. For comparisons
              between after-training novice and skilled physician scores,
              unpaired two-sample t tests were used. RESULTS: Novices
              significantly improved their dexterity and accuracy in both
              models. They missed fewer segments after training than before
              training, and had fewer contacts with the bronchial wall. There
              was no statistically significant improvement in speed or total
              time spent not visualizing airway anatomy. After training, novice
              performance equaled or surpassed that of the skilled physicians.
              Novices performed more thorough examinations and missed
              significantly fewer segments in both the inanimate and virtual
              simulation models. CONCLUSION: A short, focused course of
              instruction and unsupervised practice using a virtual
              bronchoscopy simulator enabled novice trainees to attain a level
              of manual and technical skill at performing diagnostic
              bronchoscopic inspection similar to those of colleagues with
              several years of experience. These skills were readily
              reproducible in a conventional inanimate airway-training model,

              were published in 2005, and separate guidelines for subsolid
              nodules were issued in 2013. Since then, new information has
              become available; therefore, the guidelines have been revised to
              reflect current thinking on nodule management. The revised
              guidelines incorporate several substantive changes that reflect
              current thinking on the management of small nodules. The minimum
              threshold size for routine follow-up has been increased, and
              recommended follow-up intervals are now given as a range rather
              than as a precise time period to give radiologists, clinicians,
              and patients greater discretion to accommodate individual risk
              factors and preferences. The guidelines for solid and subsolid
              nodules have been combined in one simplified table, and specific
              recommendations have been included for multiple nodules. These
              guidelines represent the consensus of the Fleischner Society, and
              as such, they incorporate the opinions of a multidisciplinary
              international group of thoracic radiologists, pulmonologists,
              surgeons, pathologists, and other specialists. Changes from the
              previous guidelines issued by the Fleischner Society are based on

              the College of American Pathologists, the International
              Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, and the Association for
              Molecular Pathology to set standards for the molecular analysis
              of lung cancers to guide treatment decisions with targeted
              inhibitors. New evidence has prompted an evaluation of additional
              laboratory technologies, targetable genes, patient populations,
              and tumor types for testing. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review
              and update the 2013 guideline to affirm its validity; to assess
              the evidence of new genetic discoveries, technologies, and
              therapies; and to issue an evidence-based update. DESIGN: The
              College of American Pathologists, the International Association
              for the Study of Lung Cancer, and the Association for Molecular
              Pathology convened an expert panel to develop an evidence-based
              guideline to help define the key questions and literature search
              terms, review abstracts and full articles, and draft
              recommendations. RESULTS: Eighteen new recommendations were
              drafted. The panel also updated 3 recommendations from the 2013
              guideline. CONCLUSIONS: The 2013 guideline was largely reaffirmed
              with updated recommendations to allow testing of cytology
              samples, require improved assay sensitivity, and recommend
              against the use of immunohistochemistry for EGFR testing. Key new
              recommendations include ROS1 testing for all adenocarcinoma
              patients; the inclusion of additional genes (ERBB2, MET, BRAF,
              KRAS, and RET) for laboratories that perform next-generation
              sequencing panels; immunohistochemistry as an alternative to
              fluorescence in situ hybridization for ALK and/or ROS1 testing;
              use of 5\% sensitivity assays for EGFR T790M mutations in
              patients with secondary resistance to EGFR inhibitors; and the
              use of cell-free DNA to ``rule in'' targetable mutations when

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer risk prediction models have the
              potential to make programs more affordable; however, the economic
              evidence is limited. METHODS: Participants in the National Lung
              Cancer Screening Trial (NLST) were retrospectively identified
              with the risk prediction tool developed from the Prostate, Lung,
              Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. The high-risk
              subgroup was assessed for lung cancer incidence and demographic
              characteristics compared with those in the low-risk subgroup and
              the Pan-Canadian Early Detection of Lung Cancer Study (PanCan),
              which is an observational study that was high-risk-selected in
              Canada. A comparison of high-risk screening versus standard care
              was made with a decision-analytic model using data from the NLST
              with Canadian cost data from screening and treatment in the
              PanCan study. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity
              analyses were undertaken to assess uncertainty and identify
              drivers of program efficiency. RESULTS: Use of the risk
              prediction tool developed from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and
              Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial with a threshold set at 2\% over 6
              years would have reduced the number of individuals who needed to
              be screened in the NLST by 81\%. High-risk screening participants
              in the NLST had more adverse demographic characteristics than
              their counterparts in the PanCan study. High-risk screening would
              cost $20,724 (in 2015 Canadian dollars) per quality-adjusted
              life-year gained and would be considered cost-effective at a
              willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 in Canadian dollars per
              quality-adjusted life-year gained with a probability of 0.62.
              Cost-effectiveness was driven primarily by non-lung cancer
              outcomes. Higher noncurative drug costs or current costs for
              immunotherapy and targeted therapies in the United States would
              render lung cancer screening a cost-saving intervention.
              CONCLUSIONS: Non-lung cancer outcomes drive screening efficiency
              in diverse, tobacco-exposed populations. Use of risk selection
              can reduce the budget impact, and screening may even offer cost
              savings if noncurative treatment costs continue to rise.",

              information about their incidence in the era of computed
              tomography (CT) is lacking. OBJECTIVES: To examine recent trends
              in pulmonary nodule identification. METHODS: We used electronic
              health records and natural language processing to identify
              members of an integrated health system who had nodules measuring
              4 to 30 mm. We calculated rates of chest CT imaging, nodule
              identification, and receipt of a new lung cancer diagnosis within
              2 years of nodule identification, and standardized rates by age
              and sex to estimate the frequency of nodule identification in the
              U.S. population in 2010. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Between
              2006 and 2012, more than 200,000 adult members underwent 415,581
              chest CT examinations. The annual frequency of chest CT imaging
              increased from 1.3 to 1.9\% for all adult members, whereas the
              frequency of nodule identification increased from 24 to 31\% for
              all scans performed. The annual rate of chest CT increased from
              15.4 to 20.7 per 1,000 person-years, and the rate of nodule
              identification increased from 3.9 to 6.6 per 1,000 person-years,
              whereas the rate of a new lung cancer diagnosis remained stable.
              By extrapolation, more than 4.8 million Americans underwent at
              least one chest CT scan and 1.57 million had a nodule identified,
              including 63,000 who received a new lung cancer diagnosis within
              2 years. CONCLUSIONS: Incidental pulmonary nodules are an
              increasingly common consequence of routine medical care, with an
              incidence that is much greater than recognized previously. More
              frequent nodule identification has not been accompanied by
              increases in the diagnosis of cancerous nodules.",

              results of the NLST (National Lung Screening Trial). The American
              College of Radiology recently released Lung-RADS, a
              classification system for LDCT lung cancer screening. OBJECTIVE:
              To retrospectively apply the Lung-RADS criteria to the NLST.
              DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a group from a randomized trial.
              SETTING: 33 U.S. screening centers. PATIENTS: Participants were
              randomly assigned to the LDCT group of the NLST, were aged 55 to
              74 years, had at least a 30-pack-year history of smoking, and
              were current smokers or had quit within the past 15 years.
              INTERVENTION: 3 annual LDCT lung cancer screenings. MEASUREMENTS:
              Lung-RADS classifications for LDCT screenings. Lung-RADS
              categories 1 to 2 constitute negative screening results, and
              categories 3 to 4 constitute positive results. RESULTS: Of 26 722
              LDCT group participants, 26 455 received a baseline screening; 48
              671 screenings were done after baseline. At baseline, the
              false-positive result rate (1 minus the specificity rate) for
              Lung-RADS was 12.8\% (95\% CI, 12.4\% to 13.2\%) versus 26.6\%
              (CI, 26.1\% to 27.1\%) for the NLST; after baseline, the
              false-positive result rate was 5.3\% (CI, 5.1\% to 5.5\%) for
              Lung-RADS versus 21.8\% (CI, 21.4\% to 22.2\%) for the NLST.
              Baseline sensitivity was 84.9\% (CI, 80.8\% to 89.0\%) for
              Lung-RADS versus 93.5\% (CI, 90.7\% to 96.3\%) for the NLST, and
              sensitivity after baseline was 78.6\% (CI, 74.6\% to 82.6\%) for
              Lung-RADS versus 93.8\% (CI, 91.4\% to 96.1\%) for the NLST.
              LIMITATION: Lung-RADS criteria were applied retrospectively.
              CONCLUSION: Lung-RADS may substantially reduce the false-positive
              result rate; however, sensitivity is also decreased. The effect
              of using Lung-RADS criteria in clinical practice must be

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is usually suspected in individuals who
              have an abnormal chest radiograph or have symptoms caused by
              either local or systemic effects of the tumor. The method of
              diagnosis of lung cancer depends on the type of lung cancer
              (small cell lung cancer or non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC]),
              the size and location of the primary tumor, the presence of
              metastasis, and the overall clinical status of the patient. The
              objective of this study was to determine the test performance
              characteristics of various modalities for the diagnosis of
              suspected lung cancer. METHODS: To update previous
              recommendations on techniques available for the initial diagnosis
              of lung cancer, a systematic search of the MEDLINE, Healthstar,
              and Cochrane Library databases covering material to July 2011 and
              print bibliographies was performed to identify studies comparing
              the results of sputum cytology, conventional bronchoscopy,
              flexible bronchoscopy (FB), electromagnetic navigation (EMN)
              bronchoscopy, radial endobronchial ultrasound (R-EBUS)-guided
              lung biopsy, transthoracic needle aspiration (TTNA) or biopsy,
              pleural fluid cytology, and pleural biopsy with histologic
              reference standard diagnoses among at least 50 patients with
              suspected lung cancer. Recommendations were developed by the
              writing committee, graded by a standardized method (see the
              article ``Methodology for Development of Guidelines for Lung
              Cancer'' in this guideline), and reviewed by all members of the
              Lung Cancer Guideline Panel prior to approval by the Thoracic
              Oncology NetWork, the Guidelines Oversight Committee, and the
              Board of Regents of the American College of Chest Physicians.
              RESULTS: Sputum cytology is an acceptable method of establishing
              the diagnosis of lung cancer, with a pooled sensitivity rate of
              66\% and a specificity rate of 99\%. However, the sensitivity of
              sputum cytology varies according to the location of the lung
              cancer. For central, endobronchial lesions, the overall
              sensitivity of FB for diagnosing lung cancer is 88\%. The
              diagnostic yield of bronchoscopy decreases for peripheral
              lesions. Peripheral lesions 2 cm in diameter showed a sensitivity
              of 34\% and 63\%, respectively. R-EBUS and EMN are emerging
              technologies for the diagnosis of peripheral lung cancer, with
              diagnostic yields of 73\% and 71\%, respectively. The pooled
              sensitivity of TTNA for the diagnosis of lung cancer was 90\%. A
              trend toward lower sensitivity was noted for lesions < 2 cm in
              diameter. TTNA is associated with a higher rate of pneumothorax
              compared with bronchoscopic procedures. In a patient with a
              malignant pleural effusion, pleural fluid cytology is reported to
              have a mean sensitivity of about 72\%. A definitive diagnosis of
              metastatic disease to the pleural space can be estalished with a
              pleural biopsy. The diagnostic yield for closed pleural biopsy
              ranges from 38\% to 47\% and from 75\% to 88\% for image-guided
              closed biopsy. Thoracoscopic biopsy of the pleura carries the
              highest diagnostic yield, 95\% to 97\%. The accuracy in
              differentiating between small cell and non-small cell cytology
              for the various diagnostic modalities was 98\%, with individual
              studies ranging from 94\% to 100\%. The average false-positive
              and false-negative rates were 9\% and 2\%, respectively. Although
              the distinction between small cell and NSCLC by cytology appears
              to be accurate, NSCLCs are clinically, pathologically, and
              molecularly heterogeneous tumors. In the past decade, clinical
              trials have shown us that NSCLCs respond to different therapeutic
              agents based on histologic phenotypes and molecular
              characteristics. The physician performing diagnostic procedures
              on a patient suspected of having lung cancer must ensure that
              adequate tissue is acquired to perform accurate histologic and
              molecular characterization of NSCLCs. CONCLUSIONS: The
              sensitivity of bronchoscopy is high for endobronchial disease and
              poor for peripheral lesions < 2 cm in diameter. The sensitivity
              of TTNA is excellent for malignant disease, but TTNA has a higher
              rate of pneumothorax than do bronchoscopic modalities. R-EBUS and
              EMN bronchoscopy show potential for increasing the diagnostic
              yield of FB for peripheral lung cancers. Thoracoscopic biopsy of
              the pleura has the highest diagnostic yield for diagnosis of
              metastatic pleural effusion in a patient with lung cancer.
              Adequate tissue acquisition for histologic and molecular
              characterization of NSCLCs is paramount.",

              was conducted utilizing several online databases, as well as web
              and hand searches. Eleven studies were identified through a
              process of elimination and critically appraised by a two-tiered
              method. Results indicated cognitive-behavioral universal
              prevention interventions can be effective on decreasing
              depressive symptomalogy in adolescents. All reviewed studies were
              conducted in the school environment by professionals and/or
              school staff; however, only three of the programs implemented
              demonstrated adoption and sustainability. School nurses can be
              instrumental in bridging the gap between the planning and
              developing of prevention programs and translation into the
              real-world school environment.",

              computer model for differentiation between malignant and benign
              pulmonary nodules detected on baseline screening computed
              tomography (CT) scans. METHODS: A case-cohort study design was
              chosen. The study group consisted of 300 chest CT scans from the
              Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial (DLCST). It included all scans
              with proven malignancies (n = 62) and two subsets of randomly
              selected baseline scans with benign nodules of all sizes (n =
              120) and matched in size to the cancers, respectively (n = 118).
              Eleven observers and the computer model (PanCan) assigned a
              malignancy probability score to each nodule. Performances were
              expressed by area under the ROC curve (AUC). Performance
              differences were tested using the Dorfman, Berbaum and Metz
              method. Seven observers assessed morphological nodule
              characteristics using a predefined list. Differences in
              morphological features between malignant and size-matched benign
              nodules were analyzed using chi-square analysis with Bonferroni
              correction. A significant difference was defined at p < 0.004.
              RESULTS: Performances of the model and observers were equivalent
              (AUC 0.932 versus 0.910, p = 0.184) for risk-assessment of
              malignant and benign nodules of all sizes. However, human readers
              performed superior to the computer model for differentiating
              malignant nodules from size-matched benign nodules (AUC 0.819
              versus 0.706, p < 0.001). Large variations between observers were
              seen for ROC areas and ranges of risk scores. Morphological
              findings indicative of malignancy referred to border
              characteristics (spiculation, p < 0.001) and perinodular
              architectural deformation (distortion of surrounding lung
              parenchyma architecture, p < 0.001; pleural retraction, p =
              0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Computer model and human observers perform
              equivalent for differentiating malignant from randomly selected
              benign nodules, confirming the high potential of computer models
              for nodule risk estimation in population based screening studies.
              However, computer models highly rely on size as discriminator.
              Incorporation of other morphological criteria used by human
              observers to superiorly discriminate size-matched malignant from
              benign nodules, will further improve computer performance.",

              Results In the validation cohort, the area under the receiver

              the sensitivity, specificity, and PPV of the NLST investigators
              were 1.00, 0.00, and 0.43, respectively. The sensitivity,
              specificity, PPV, and negative predictive value of CAD and the
              three radiologists' combined reading were 0.95, 0.88, 0.86, and

              were ineligible for lung cancer screening and to investigate
              whether this encounter may represent an opportunity to reduce
              tobacco use. METHODS: Ever smokers between the ages of 55 and 80
              and $\geq$1.5\% lung cancer risk over 6 years or having smoked
              $\geq$30 pack-years and with no more than 15 years of smoking
              abstinence were eligible to participate in the Alberta Lung
              Cancer Screening Program (ALCSP). A baseline questionnaire
              exploring tobacco use was administered to all interested
              individuals as part of the eligibility determination for the
              program. RESULTS: Among 504 individuals, 254 (50.4\%) met the
              criteria for the ALCSP and 250 (49.6\%) were non-eligible for
              screening. Non-eligible individuals were slightly younger
              (mean=60.2 vs. 63.1 years, p-value <0.001), and less likely to be
              current smokers (26.0\% vs. 48.8\%, p-value <0.001). Non-eligible
              smokers had a lower degree of addiction compared to eligible
              group, as measured by the Fagerstr{\"o}m Test of Nicotine
              Dependence (Median=4.0 vs 6.0, p-value=0.001), but still in the
              ``moderately dependent'' range for this test. There were no
              significant differences in motivation to quit (98.5\% vs. 97.6\%,
              p-value=0.689), or motivation to receive help with their quit
              attempt (89.2\% vs. 90.3\%, p-value=0.813) between these two
              groups. Only 7.7\% of non-eligible and 2.4\% of eligible current
              smokers were currently in a smoking cessation program.
              CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of individuals applying to,
              but not qualifying for a lung cancer screening program are active
              smokers with significant nicotine dependence. Very few are
              currently participating in active smoking cessation programs but
              almost all are interested in quitting and in receiving help with
              quit attempts. Future studies need to investigate the most
              effective approaches for smoking cessation in this substantial
              group of older, long-term smokers, capitalizing on their
              motivation to receive cessation assistance.",

              methods have on performances. METHODS: From the Danish Lung
              Cancer Screening Trial database, 64 CTs with malignant nodules
              and 549 baseline CTs with benign nodules were included.
              Performance of the systems was evaluated applying the system's
              original diameter definitions: Dlongest-C (PanCan), DmeanAxial
              (NCCN), both obtained from axial sections, and Dmean3D
              (Lung-RADS). Subsequently all diameter definitions were applied
              uniformly to all systems. Areas under the ROC curves (AUC) were
              used to evaluate risk discrimination. RESULTS: PanCan performed
              superiorly to Lung-RADS and NCCN (AUC 0.874 vs. 0.813, p = 0.003;
              0.874 vs. 0.836, p = 0.010), using the original diameter

              = 0.001) and NCCN (p < 0.001 - p = 0.016). Diameter definition
              significantly influenced NCCN's performance with Dlongest-C being

              DmeanAxial, p = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: Without follow-up
              information, the PanCan model performs significantly superiorly
              to Lung-RADS and the 1.2016 NCCN guidelines for discriminating

              outperforms Lung-RADS and 1.2016 NCCN guidelines in identifying
              malignant pulmonary nodules. • Nodule size definition had no
              significant impact on Lung-RADS and PanCan model. • 1.2016 NCCN

              risk, and those who continue to smoke after diagnosis have a
              worse survival. Screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed
              tomography (LDCT) reduces mortality in high-risk individuals.
              Smoking cessation is an essential component of a high-quality
              screening program. OBJECTIVES: To quantify the effects of smoking
              history and abstinence on mortality in high-risk individuals who
              participated in the NLST (National Lung Screening Trial).
              METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled
              trial (NLST). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Measurements
              included self-reported demographics, medical and smoking history,
              and lung cancer-specific and all-cause mortality. Cox regression
              was used to study the association of mortality with smoking
              status and pack-years. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were examined
              for differences in survival based on trial arm and smoking
              status. Current smokers had an increased lung cancer-specific
              (hazard ratio [HR], 2.14-2.29) and all-cause mortality (HR,
              1.79-1.85) compared with former smokers irrespective of screening
              arm. Former smokers in the control arm abstinent for 7 years had
              a 20\% mortality reduction comparable with the benefit reported
              with LDCT screening in the NLST. The maximum benefit was seen
              with the combination of smoking abstinence at 15 years and LDCT
              screening, which resulted in a 38\% reduction in lung
              cancer-specific mortality (HR, 0.62; 95\% confidence interval,
              0.51-0.76). CONCLUSIONS: Seven years of smoking abstinence
              reduced lung cancer-specific mortality at a magnitude comparable
              with LDCT screening. This reduction was greater when abstinence
              was combined with screening, highlighting the importance of

              incremental net benefit of a technology, therapies can also be
              classified into five ``grades of recommendation.'' A grade A
              technology is both more effective and cheaper than the existing
              one, whereas a grade E technology is less or equally effective

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Peripheral pulmonary nodules are increasingly
              detected in patients screened for lung cancer or during disease
              progression of thoracic or extrathoracic malignancies. Sampling
              these lesions requires surgery, computed tomography (CT)-guided
              biopsy or bronchoscopic interventions. Bronchoscopic
              interventions are preferable because they have lower
              complications and often patients may not be ideal candidates for
              surgical or CT-guided biopsy. In addition, guidelines recommend
              diagnosis and staging in one single procedure. The diagnostic
              yield of existing advanced bronchoscopic techniques including
              electromagnetic navigation, radial probe ultrasonography,
              ultrathin bronchoscopy or virtual bronchoscopy remains
              suboptimal. The purpose of this paper is to codify the technique
              whereby a diagnostic bronchoscopy is performed using the new
              robotic platform. METHODS: In the present report, I describe the
              technique for performing robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (RAB)
              using the Monarch™ platform (Auris Health, Inc., Redwood City,

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE Surgical robotics has demonstrated utility across the
              spectrum of surgery. Robotics in spine surgery, however, remains
              in its infancy. Here, the authors systematically review the
              evidence behind robotic applications in spinal instrumentation.
              METHODS This systematic review was conducted according to the
              Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
              Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Relevant studies (through
              October 2016) that reported the use of robotics in spinal
              instrumentation were identified from a search of the PubMed
              database. Data regarding the accuracy of screw placement, surgeon
              learning curve, radiation exposure, and reasons for robotic
              failure were extracted. RESULTS Twenty-five studies describing 2
              unique robots met inclusion criteria. Of these, 22 studies
              evaluated accuracy of spinal instrumentation. Although grading of
              pedicle screw accuracy was variable, the most commonly used
              method was the Gertzbein and Robbins system of classification. In
              the studies using the Gertzbein and Robbins system, accuracy
              (Grades A and B) ranged from 85\% to 100\%. Ten studies evaluated
              radiation exposure during the procedure. In studies that detailed
              fluoroscopy usage, overall fluoroscopy times ranged from 1.3 to
              34 seconds per screw. Nine studies examined the learning curve
              for the surgeon, and 12 studies described causes of robotic
              failure, which included registration failure, soft-tissue
              hindrance, and lateral skiving of the drill guide. CONCLUSIONS
              Robotics in spine surgery is an emerging technology that holds
              promise for future applications. Surgical accuracy in
              instrumentation implanted using robotics appears to be high.
              However, the impact of robotics on radiation exposure is not
              clear and seems to be dependent on technique and robot type.",

  author   = "Galloway, R and McGuire, J",
  abstract = "Iron deficiency anemia affects over 2 billion people.
              Particularly at risk are pregnant women and young children.
              Although distribution of iron supplements is practised in many
              antenatal care programs in developing countries, it has often
              been alleged that pregnant women do not take them. Poor
              compliance arises not only because of patient behavior but also
              from factors out of the patient's control. This paper presents
              the results of a review of the literature on medical compliance
              to determine whether iron supplementation is different from other
              medications, to assess the known levels of compliance, and to
              synthesize recommendations for improving compliance relevant to
              iron supplementation. The review showed that compliance with iron
              therapy is a specific case of medical compliance. Reasons for
              non-compliance with iron deficiency treatment include: inadequate
              program support (lack of political commitment and financial
              support); insufficient service delivery (poor provider-user
              dynamics; lack of supplies, access, training, and motivation of
              health care professionals); and patient factors (misunderstanding
              instructions, side effects, frustration about the frequency and
              number of pills taken, migration, fear of having big babies,
              personal problems, nausea that accompanies pregnancy, and the
              subtlety of anemia which makes demand for treatment low). Much
              has been made about the side effects (nausea, constipation, etc.)
              that women might experience during iron therapy as the cause of
              poor compliance with iron supplementation without justification
              according to this review. Instead, unavailability of iron
              supplements was the most common reason why women did not take
              iron supplements. Women bear a disproportionate burden from iron
              deficiency anemia even though the technology exists to address
              the problem at low cost. Governments and health care
              professionals must renew their commitment to iron therapy by
              monitoring and improving compliance. We can significantly improve
              compliance by: making sure that iron supplements are available at
              all times; providing advanced warning about the possibility of
              side effects; involving the patient in the therapeutic strategy;

               individuals have for sweet carbohydrate/fat rich foods seems to
               result from the enhancement in mood following consumption.
               Paradoxically, however, a better long-term strategy for mood
               enhancement may be to totally eliminate added sucrose and

               26 male subjects (34+/-6 y; BMI 23.4+/-2.2 kg m(-2)).
               MEASUREMENTS: Blood glucose, insulin, triacylglycerols (TG),

               of a SCHO breakfast resulted in higher glucose and insulin

               Consumption of a CCHO breakfast is favourable in comparison to a

               consumed one of two breakfasts or no breakfast and then
               completed a battery of cognitive tests. The two breakfasts were

               characteristics, effects on digestion and metabolism, and
               glycemic score. Results with 9 to 11 year-olds replicated
               previous findings showing that breakfast intake enhances

               processing of a complex visual display. The results extend

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Nutrition is often a casualty of the busy work day
              for physicians. We aimed to explore physicians' views of their
              nutrition in the workplace including their perceptions of the
              impact of inadequate nutrition upon their personal wellness and
              their professional performance. METHODS: This is a qualitative
              study of a sample of 20 physicians practicing in a large urban
              teaching hospital. Semi-structured open ended interviews were
              conducted to explore physicians' views of workplace nutrition.
              The same physicians had agreed to participate in a related
              nutrition based wellness intervention study that compared
              nutritional intake and cognitive function during a day of usual
              nutrition patterns against another day with scheduled nutrition
              breaks. A second set of interviews was conducted after the
              intervention study to explore how participation in the
              intervention impacted these views. Detailed interview content
              notes were transcribed and analyzed independently with
              differences reconciled by discussion. RESULTS: At initial
              interview, participants reported difficulty accessing adequate
              nutrition at work, linking this deficit with emotional (irritable
              and frustrated), physical (tired and hungry), and cognitive
              (difficulty concentrating and poor decision making) symptoms. In
              addition to identifying practical barriers such as lack of time
              to stop and eat, inconvenient access to food and poor food
              choices, the physicians described how their sense of
              professionalism and work ethic also hinder their work nutrition
              practices. After participating in the intervention, most
              physicians reported heightened awareness of their nutrition
              patterns and intentions to improve their workplace nutrition.
              CONCLUSIONS: Physicians report that inadequate workplace
              nutrition has a significant negative impact on their personal
              wellness and professional performance. Given this threat to
              health care delivery, health care organizations and the medical

               scientific methods as we know them today were not in use at the
               time. Modern scientific methods in neuroscience began to emerge

               health, including mental wellbeing, with greater precision. This
               review shows how short- and long-term forced dietary
               interventions bring about changes in brain structure, chemistry,
               and physiology, leading to altered animal behavior. Examples
               will be presented to show how diets alter brain chemistry,
               behavior, and the action of neuroactive drugs. Most humans and
               most animal species examined in a controlled setting exhibit a
               fairly reproducible pattern of what and how they eat. Recent
               data suggest that these patterns may be under the neurochemical

              affect a large population at risk for epidemics of sedentary
              lifestyle; however, it is unclear what type of counseling they
              provide. METHODS: A questionnaire was used to obtain information
              on primary care physicians' behaviors with respect to counseling
              and prescribing physical activity, physician demographics, and
              practice characteristics. Registered primary care physicians in
              Canada were contacted in all 10 provinces and 2 territories.
              RESULTS: Of 27 980 primary care physicians, 14 319 returned
              usable questionnaires and 13 166 were eligible for study
              participation (response rate, 51.2\%). Respondents were
              predominantly male (61.1\%), practiced in private office/clinic
              settings (73.4\%), and had graduated from medical school more
              than 22 years earlier. Eighty-five percent of respondents
              reported asking patients about their physical activity levels,
              whereas only 26.2\% assessed patient fitness as part of a
              physical examination or through a fitness test and only 10.9\%
              referred patients to others for fitness assessment or appraisal.
              Most physicians (69.8\%) reported using verbal counseling to
              promote physical activity, whereas only 15.8\% used written
              prescriptions for a physical activity promotion program. Male and
              female physicians responded differently. Men more frequently
              assessed fitness than did women, whereas women more frequently
              asked and provided verbal and written directions. CONCLUSIONS:
              This large sample of Canadian primary care physicians regularly
              asked patients about physical activity levels and advised them
              using verbal counseling. Few respondents provided written

              outpatients. Both programmes included behaviour modification,
              nutrition counselling, very-low-calorie diet (VLCD) and a
              continuous measuring of metabolic and anthropometrical status,
              but they differed regarding the treatment intensiveness. The main
              aim was to study whether intensive treatment gives a larger
              weight reduction compared with less intensive treatment and what
              level of input from health care personnel is needed to reach
              adequate treatment results. DESIGN: A 2-y randomised clinical
              trial. SUBJECTS: A total of 43 obese subjects aged 24-60 y, BMI
              35 kg/m(2) (29-48). INTERVENTION: Two programmes were used. Both
              were based on group therapy and were supervised by a dietitian
              and a psychologist. Group 1 received a continuous intensive
              treatment with planned group meetings every fortnight during the
              first year and six group meetings the second year. Group 2 had
              planned group meetings every third month. Anthropometrical and
              metabolic data were measured every third month in both groups.
              The VLCD periods were the same. RESULTS: There was no evidence
              that a more intensive treatment promotes a larger weight
              reduction. Weight reduction after 1 y: group 1, -7.6 (+/-0.97)
              kg, BMI -2.6 (+/-0.3) kg/m(2); group 2, -6.4 (+/-1.16) kg, BMI
              -2.2 (+/-0.4) kg/m(2). Weight reduction after 2 y: group 1, -6.8
              (+/-1.4) kg, BMI -2.4 (+/-0.3) kg/m(2); group 2, -8.6 (+/-1.6)
              kg, BMI -3.0 (+/-0.3) kg/m(2). The dropout rate was 26\%.
              CONCLUSION: There were no significant differences in weight
              reduction, compliance or dropout rate between the groups and
              there was no evidence that a more intensive treatment promotes a
              larger weight reduction. This observation is of value when
              setting up treatment programmes. To measure the metabolic and
              anthropometrical status during the treatment and to give
              continuous feedback to the subjects seem to be important factors
              for compliance. Both treatment programmes gave highly significant
              weight reductions in the range of 5-10\%, which has been referred
              to as a realistic goal for the treatment of obese patients.",

  abstract = "PURPOSE: Orthorexia nervosa (ON, i.e., fixation on righteous
              eating) is a poorly defined disordered eating behavior that
              results from a pathological obsession with food, its purported
              nutritional value, composition, origin, etc. METHODS: We
              investigated the prevalence of ON in a local ashtanga yoga
              community, by using a validated questionnaire (ORTO-15) that sets
              a threshold of ON diagnosis at $\leq$40. RESULTS: Among the 136
              respondents, the mean ORTO-15 score (which was normally
              distributed) was 35.27 $\pm$ 3.69, i.e., 86 \% of respondents had
              an ORTO-15 score lower than 40 and no significant association
              with age or BMI was recorded. When we analyzed the differential
              distribution of orthorexia in our cohort, we recorded an
              association of ORTO-15 score and vegetarianism, i.e., the ORTO-15
              score was lower among vegetarians. CONCLUSIONS: The results of
              this pilot study should suggest ashtanga yoga teachers to avoid
              excessive reference to a healthy diet, which is natural component
              of yoga practice.",

  abstract = "Orthorexia nervosa describes a pathological obsession with proper
              nutrition that is characterized by a restrictive diet, ritualized
              patterns of eating, and rigid avoidance of foods believed to be
              unhealthy or impure. Although prompted by a desire to achieve
              optimum health, orthorexia may lead to nutritional deficiencies,
              medical complications, and poor quality of life. Despite its
              being a distinct behavioral pattern that is frequently observed
              by clinicians, orthorexia has received very little empirical
              attention and is not yet formally recognized as a psychiatric
              disorder. In this review, we synthesize existing research to
              identify what is known about the symptoms, prevalence,
              neuropsychological profile, and treatment of orthorexia. An
              examination of diagnostic boundaries reveals important points of
              symptom overlap between orthorexia and anorexia nervosa,
              obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), obsessive-compulsive
              personality disorder (OCPD), somatic symptom disorder, illness
              anxiety disorder, and psychotic spectrum disorders.
              Neuropsychological data suggest that orthorexic symptoms are
              independently associated with key facets of executive dysfunction
              for which some of these conditions already overlap. Discussion of
              cognitive weaknesses in set-shifting, external attention, and
              working memory highlights the value of continued research to
              identify intermediate, transdiagnostic endophenotypes for insight
              into the neuropathogenesis of orthorexia. An evaluation of
              current orthorexia measures indicates a need for further
              psychometric development to ensure that subsequent research has
              access to reliable and valid assessment tools. Optimized
              assessment will not only permit a clearer understanding of
              prevalence rates, psychosocial risk factors, and comorbid
              psychopathology but will also be needed to index intervention
              effectiveness. Though the field lacks data on therapeutic
              outcomes, current best practices suggest that orthorexia can
              successfully be treated with a combination of

              university students with high levels of healthy food

              were 327 female (N = 283) and male (N = 44) students aged 18 to
              25 years. All participants completed the Polish adaptation of the
              15-item questionnaire assessing orthorexia eating behaviours (the
              ORTHO-15) and the Multidimensional Body-Self Relations
              Questionnaire (the MBSRQ). Relationships between scores on the
              ORTHO-15 and MBSRQ were explored in the 213 students who had high
              levels of preoccupation with a healthy food intake (68.55\% women
              and 43.18\% men, respectively). RESULTS: There were no
              statistically significant differences in the levels of orthorexia
              behaviours between females and males. In female students with
              orthorexia nervosa, preoccupation with consuming healthy food was
              significantly correlated with the MBSRQ subscale scores for
              overweight preoccupation, appearance orientation, fitness
              orientation, health orientation, body areas satisfaction and
              appearance evaluation. Conversely, in male students with
              orthorexia nervosa there were no correlations between orthorexic
              behaviours and the MBSRQ subscales. In female students with

              high body areas (parts) satisfaction, low fitness orientation,
              low overweight preoccupation and low appearance orientation were
              independent predictors of greater fixation on eating healthy
              food. In male students, we found that aspects of body image were
              not associated with preoccupation with healthy eating.
              CONCLUSION: A strong preoccupation with healthy and proper food

              pathological when cognitions and worries about healthy nutrition
              lead to such an accurate food selection that correct diet becomes
              the most important part of one's own life leading to important
              dietary restrictions, stereotyped eating or impairment in
              important areas of functioning. This behaviour is coined
              orthorexia nervosa (ON) and can share common characteristics with
              anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN). The purpose of
              the present study was to examine the frequency of ON among women
              with eating disorders (EDs) and to evaluate if it changed after
              treating the ED. METHODS: Thirty-two patients with AN or BN were
              evaluated by means of the ORTO-15, the Yale-Brown-Cornell Eating
              Disorder Scale (YBC-EDS) and the Eating Attitude Test (EAT-26)
              before (t0) and 3 years after the treatment of their ED (t1), and
              compared to 32 female healthy controls (HC) matched by gender,

              patients either at t0 (28 \%) or t1 (58 \%) resulted positive to

              prevalent among patients with AN and BN, and tend to increase

              19 and 70 years (M = 31.21 $\pm$ 10.43 years). Our results showed
              that after confirmatory factor analysis, the best fitting model
              of the original version is a single-factor structure (9-item
              shortened version: ORTO-9-GE). The final model showed only
              moderate internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = .67), even
              after omitting 40\% of the original question. A total of 69.1\%
              participants showed orthorectic tendencies. Orthorectic
              tendencies are associated with special eating behavior features
              (dieting frequency, vegetarian and vegan diet). Education level
              did not influence ON tendency and nutritional students did not
              show higher ON tendency compared to students from other
              disciplines. This study is the first attempt to translate and to
              evaluate the psychometric properties of a German version of the
              ORTO-15 questionnaire. The ORTO-9-GE questionnaire, however, is
              only a mediocre tool for assessing orthorectic tendencies in

  abstract = "Bratman first proposed orthorexia nervosa in the late 1990s,
              defining it an obsession with eating healthy food to achieve, for
              instance, improved health. Today, in the Swedish media, excessive
              exercising plays a central role in relation to orthorexia. A few
              review articles on orthorexia have been conducted; however, these
              have not focused on aspects of food and eating, sport, exercise,
              or a societal perspective. The overall aim of this study was to
              provide an overview and synthesis of what philosophies of science
              approaches form the current academic framework of orthorexia. Key
              questions were: What aspects of food and eating are related to
              orthorexia? What role do exercise and sports play in relation to
              orthorexia? In what ways are orthorexia contextualized?
              Consequently, the concept of healthism was used to discuss and
              contextualize orthorexia. The method used was an integrative
              literature review; the material covered 19 empirical and
              theoretical articles published in peer-reviewed journals. This
              review demonstrates a multifaceted nature of orthorexia research;
              this field has been examined from four different philosophies of
              science approaches (i.e., empirical-atomistic,
              empirical-atomistic with elements of empirical-holistic,
              empirical-holistic, and rational-holistic) on individual, social,
              and societal levels. The majority of the articles followed an
              empirical-atomistic approach that focused on orthorexia as an
              individual issue, which was discussed using healthism. Our
              analysis indicates a need for (a) more empirical-holistic
              research that applies interpretive qualitative methods and uses a
              social perspective of health, e.g., healthism and (b) examining
              the role of sports and exercise in relation to orthorexia that
              takes the problematizing of ``orthorexic behaviours'' within the
              sports context into account.",

              the traits of orthorexia and muscle dysmorphia among freshmen
              attending university courses focused on nutrition (Dietetics) and
              body care (Exercise and Sport Sciences). Students of Biology were
              considered as a control group. The prevalence of eating disorder
              (ED) traits were also evaluated. METHODS: All participants (n =
              440; n = 53 Dietetics school, n = 200 Exercise and Sport Sciences
              school, n = 187 the Biology school) completed the following
              questionnaires: ORTO-15, Muscle-Dysmorphic-Disorder-Inventory,
              and Eating Attitudes Test-26. RESULTS: The prevalence of the
              traits of EDs, orthorexia, and muscle dysmorphia was 9.1\%,
              25.9\%, and 5.9\%, respectively. When compared to other students,
              those attending the Dietetics school showed a 2-fold higher risk
              of EDs and those from the Exercise and Sport Sciences school a
              10-fold higher risk of muscle dysmorphia. The prevalence of
              orthorexia traits was high in all schools (35.9\%, 22.5\%, 26.5\%
              in Dietetics, Biology, and Exercise and Sport Sciences schools,
              respectively). Overall, individuals with traits of any of these
              disorders were more frequently on diet or on supplement use. In a
              logistic regression model, attending the Dietetics school (OR =
              2.71; 95\% CI 1.14-6.48) was significantly associated with the ED
              traits, but not with the orthorexia traits (OR = 1.75; 95\% CI
              0.93-3.29), while attending the Exercise and Sport Sciences
              school was significantly associated with the muscle dysmorphia
              traits (OR = 5.15; 95\% CI 1.44-18.4). Finally, when evaluating
              the relationships among the types of study programs as dependent
              variables and traits of these disturbances, the associations
              between the traits of ED (OR = 3.35; 95\% CI 1.38-8.13) and

              choice of the Exercise and Sport Sciences school were confirmed.
              CONCLUSIONS: The choice of the university courses might be

  author   = "Russell, Katelyn",
  abstract = "Dietitians are expected to deliver sound and scientifically
              objective advice to the general public, yet their personal
              beliefs and behaviors could influence delivery of nutrition care.
              Increased understanding of the personal attitudes and behaviors
              of dietitians concerning eating behavior and body image could
              help improve dietetic practice. Traditional nutrition education
              emphasizes cognitive eating, i.e., monitoring energy intake and
              comparing macronutrient intakes to the current acceptable ranges.
              Intuitive eating, however, promotes the release of cognitive
              eating in favor of greater attention to physiologic cues, or
              ``body wisdom''. We hypothesized that nutrition students in a
              traditional curriculum would report eating less intuitively than
              non-nutrition majors. We surveyed 258 female undergraduate
              students (96 nutrition majors and 162 non-majors) at the
              University of Massachusetts Amherst. Using Mann-Whitney U tests,
              we assessed the differences between nutrition majors and
              non-majors in terms of: intuitive eating, as measured by the
              Intuitive Eating Scale-2 (IES-2); body mass index (BMI, kg/m2);
              magnitude of body dissatisfaction (actual weight -- ideal
              weight); and dieting behavior. We also used non-parametric
              Spearman's rho correlations and Chi-squared statistics to examine
              relationships between variables. A two-way between-groups
              analysis of variance was used to calculate statistical
              differences in intuitive eating scores between diet behavior and
              major. Contrary to our working hypothesis, we found that IES-2
              scores were significantly higher in majors versus non-majors (p=
              0.01) and significantly lower (pnormalor underweight BMI. These
              observations provide novel information indicating that nutrition
              undergraduate students, who have the intention of becoming
              registered dietitians, report that they eat more intuitively and
              have a lower degree of body dissatisfaction than do undergraduate
              students not majoring in nutrition. Additional research is needed
              to address issues related to body dissatisfaction and body

              investigating why people with disordered eating are reluctant to
              engage with treatment services (March 2012 to March 2015), we
              demonstrate how young women use elements of a 'health habitus'
              and 'care' to rationalise and justify their practices. Moving
              beyond Foucauldian theories of self-discipline and individual
              responsibility we argue that Bourdieu's concept of habitus and
              ethnographic concepts of care provide a deeper understanding of
              the ways in which people with disordered eating embody health
              practices as a form of care and distinction. We demonstrate how
              eating and bodily practices that entail 'natural', medical and
              ethical concerns (in particular, the new food regime known as
              orthorexia) are successfully incorporated into participants'
              eating disorder repertoires and embodied as a logic of care.

              disorder in which the person is excessively preoccupied with
              healthy food. First described by Bratman in 1997, ON entails a
              fixation on healthy food or a health food dependence. The term
              orthorexia nervosa arises from the Greek words orthos (=accurate)
              and orexis (=hunger) meaning obsession with healthy food and
              proper nutrition. Fears and worries about health, eating, and the
              quality of food are significant. Objectives We investigated the
              prevalence of ON in a a population of young Italian adults by
              using a validated questionnaire (ORTO-15). Aims We aimed to
              assess the prevalence of ON in a large sample of general
              population and to identify some possible specific correlation
              such as gender and Body Mass Index (BMI). Methods 1453 adult
              subjects from the general population were administered the
              ORTO-15 test and investigated for gender, age and BMI.
              Statistical analyses were performed referring to diagnostic
              threshold (40). Results Orthorexia had a 10,9\% prevalence in our
              sample, with a female prevalence statistically significant
              (female vs male= 72,8\% vs 27,2\%). Moreover, age and Body Mass
              Index did not seem to be significant factors. Conclusions ON is
              not currently considered as a full-fledged and discrete mental
              disorder. Again, the definition and diagnostic criteria of ON
              remain unclear. Further studies are needed to clarify appropriate
              diagnostic methods and the place of ON among psychopathological
              categories. This should be accompanied by a vigorous research

              Of 878 students, 464 (52.8\%) were male and 359 (40.9\%) were
              female. The mean age, height, weight, and body mass index were
              21.3 +/- 2.1 years, 171.0 +/- 8.5 cm, 65.6 +/- 12.3 kg, 22.4 +/-
              2.99, respectively. The rates of the ORTO-11 scores between 0 and
              15 was 1.9\%; between 16 and 30, 57.5\%; and between 31 and
              higher, 21.1\%. There were 17 students with a score of 0 to 15.
              The mean score for the ORTO-11 test was 27. There were
              statistically significant differences between age, sex, and
              smoking habit of the students. In the male students, there was a
              statistically significantly higher tendency for orthorexia (P =
              .001), and there was a statistically significant difference
              between the age groups for tendency for orthorexia (P = .025). In
              logistic regression analysis, age, sex, Eating Attitude Test-40

              the ORTO-15 Questionnaire in the group of the Polish schoolgirls
              and schoolboys. METHODS: The study included 399 participants
              (15-21 years old), all of them high school students in the city
              of Sosnowiec. The ORTO-15 is a tool created in Italy by L.M.
              Donini, comprising of 15 items describing intensification of
              orthorexia risk (population diagnosis). The validation procedure
              incorporated three basic methods to be applied in the reliability
              analysis - the comparison of double tests with the same method,
              the statistical properties analysis of test items as well as
              analysis of the relation of test items with the general test
              result. Moreover, the compliance of the ORTO-15 Questionnaire
              results with other questionnaire focused on eating habits
              (EAT-26) was studied. RESULTS: The reliability analysis of the
              ORTO-15 Questionnaire based on repeatability of the responses
              presents a very good (kappa: 0.81 - 1.00 for 5 items) and a good
              repeatability (kappa: 0.61 - 0.80 for 10 items). The reliability
              analysis based on the value of the Cronbach's $\alpha$ reached a
              satisfactory level (0.7 - 0.9). A full agreement of in the
              occurrence of orthorexia risk and the risk of eating disorders

              Athlete Triad. This Consensus Statement replaces the previous and
              provides guidelines to guide risk assessment, treatment and
              return-to-play decisions. The IOC expert working group introduces
              a broader, more comprehensive term for the condition previously
              known as 'Female Athlete Triad'. The term 'Relative Energy
              Deficiency in Sport' (RED-S), points to the complexity involved
              and the fact that male athletes are also affected. The syndrome
              of RED-S refers to impaired physiological function including, but
              not limited to, metabolic rate, menstrual function, bone health,
              immunity, protein synthesis, cardiovascular health caused by
              relative energy deficiency. The cause of this syndrome is energy
              deficiency relative to the balance between dietary energy intake
              and energy expenditure required for health and activities of
              daily living, growth and sporting activities. Psychological
              consequences can either precede RED-S or be the result of RED-S.
              The clinical phenomenon is not a 'triad' of the three entities of
              energy availability, menstrual function and bone health, but
              rather a syndrome that affects many aspects of physiological
              function, health and athletic performance. This Consensus
              Statement also recommends practical clinical models for the
              management of affected athletes. The 'Sport Risk Assessment and
              Return to Play Model' categorises the syndrome into three groups

              `health' and `care' are engaged with and practiced by women with
              disordered eating. Based on findings from an Australian study
              investigating why people with disordered eating are reluctant to
              engage with treatment services (March 2012 to March 2015), we
              demonstrate how young women use elements of a `health habitus'
              and `care' to rationalise and justify their practices. Moving
              beyond Foucauldian theories of self-discipline and individual
              responsibility we argue that Bourdieu's concept of habitus and
              ethnographic concepts of care provide a deeper understanding of
              the ways in which people with disordered eating embody health
              practices as a form of care and distinction. We demonstrate how
              eating and bodily practices that entail `natural', medical and
              ethical concerns (in particular, the new food regime known as
              orthorexia) are successfully incorporated into participants'
              eating disorder repertoires and embodied as a logic of care.
              Understanding how categories of health and care are tinkered with
              and practiced by people with disordered eating has important
              implications for health professionals, family members and peers

              attitudinal body image in ED patients; 2) to identify possible
              predictors of orthorexia nervosa among ED patients. METHODS:
              Fifty-two women diagnosed with EDs were recruited. Patients'
              assessment included the following: the ORTO-15 test (Polish
              version) for orthorexic behaviours; the Eating Attitude Test-26
              (EAT-26) to identify ED symptoms; the Multidimensional Body-Self
              Relations Questionnaire (Polish version) to assess body image.
              RESULTS: A latent class analysis was performed and differences
              between identified classes were assessed. The main differences
              concerned weight, ED pathology and orthorexic behaviours within
              the same group of ED patients. In order to examine predictors of
              orthorexia nervosa, we investigated a structural equation model,
              which excellently fitted to the data ($\chi$ (2) (17) = 23.05; p
              = .148; CFI = .962; RMSEA = .08; p = .25; SRMR = .05). In ED
              patients, orthorexic behaviour was negatively predicted by eating
              pathology, weight concern, health orientation and appearance
              orientation. CONCLUSION: The assessment of the orthorexia
              construct in EDs may add to the paucity of studies about this
              issue and may help to clarify the relationship between the two.
              Differences and similarities seem to exist between these
              disorders, and may benefit from specific treatment approaches.

              level that results in bodyweight losses of approximately 0.5 to
              1\%/wk to maximize muscle retention. Within this caloric intake,
              most but not all bodybuilders will respond best to consuming
              2.3-3.1 g/kg of lean body mass per day of protein, 15-30\% of
              calories from fat, and the reminder of calories from
              carbohydrate. Eating three to six meals per day with a meal
              containing 0.4-0.5 g/kg bodyweight of protein prior and
              subsequent to resistance training likely maximizes any
              theoretical benefits of nutrient timing and frequency. However,
              alterations in nutrient timing and frequency appear to have
              little effect on fat loss or lean mass retention. Among popular
              supplements, creatine monohydrate, caffeine and beta-alanine
              appear to have beneficial effects relevant to contest
              preparation, however others do not or warrant further study. The
              practice of dehydration and electrolyte manipulation in the final
              days and hours prior to competition can be dangerous, and may not
              improve appearance. Increasing carbohydrate intake at the end of
              preparation has a theoretical rationale to improve appearance,
              however it is understudied. Thus, if carbohydrate loading is
              pursued it should be practiced prior to competition and its
              benefit assessed individually. Finally, competitors should be
              aware of the increased risk of developing eating and body image
              disorders in aesthetic sport and therefore should have access to
              the appropriate mental health professionals.",

              disorders, it is necessary to investigate their subtypes and
              develop specific assessment tools to measure their specific
              symptoms. Orthorexia nervosa is an alleged eating disorder in
              which the person is excessively preoccupied with healthy food.
              The ORTO-15, designed by Donini and colleagues, is the first and
              only at least partially validated instrument to measure this
              construct. The aims of the present study were to examine the
              psychometric properties of its Hungarian adaptation (ORTO-11-Hu),
              and to investigate its relationship to food consumption and
              lifestyle habits in order to contribute to a better description
              of the phenomenon. METHODS: The ORTO-11-Hu, a lifestyle habits
              questionnaire, a food choice list indicating foods the
              participants choose to consume, and ten additional
              orthorexia-related questions were administered to a group of 810
              Hungarian participants (89.4\% female) aged between 20 and 70 (M
              = 32.39 $\pm$ 10.37 years). RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis
              suggested a single factor structure for the 11-item shortened
              version of the instrument. Internal consistency of the measure
              was adequate (Cronbach's alpha = 0.82). No significant
              differences were found between males and females on the
              ORTO-11-Hu. Age and body mass index were significantly associated
              with a tendency towards orthorexia nervosa. Additional
              orthorexia-related features were significantly correlated with
              ORTO-11-Hu scores: orthorexia nervosa tendency was associated not
              only with healthier food choices (eating more whole wheat
              cereals, less white wheat cereals, more fruit and vegetables) but
              with shopping in health food stores, as well as with some healthy
              lifestyle habits (more sports activity, specific dietary
              behaviors, and less alcohol intake). Individuals with higher
              orthorexia nervosa tendency also reported a greater tendency to
              advocate their healthy diet to their friends and family members.
              CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence for the reliability
              of ORTO-11-Hu and some support for the construct validity of the
              instrument. The present study also contributes to the

              A rationale is provided for a more inclusive definition of
              culture, a means of integrating additional domains of practice,
              and a shift away from the narrow focus on strategies and
              techniques. A new model of culture-infused counselling is
              proposed that is centered on the working alliance between
              counsellors and clients. It is argued that the concept of the
              working alliance is a pantheoretical and superordinate construct
              that provides a more sound organizational structure for the
              competency frameworks. Intervention strategies and techniques may

              and collaborative work that characterizes a culturally sensitive

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Appearance comparison has consistently been shown to
              engender body image dissatisfaction. To date, most studies have
              demonstrated this relationship between appearance comparison and
              body image dissatisfaction in the context of conventional media
              images depicting the thin-ideal. Social comparison theory posits
              that people are more likely to compare themselves to similar
              others. Since social media forums such as Facebook involve one's
              peers, the current study aimed to determine whether the
              relationship between appearance comparison and body image
              dissatisfaction would be stronger for those exposed to social
              media images, compared to conventional media images. METHODS: A
              sample of 193 female first year university students were randomly
              allocated to view a series of either Facebook or conventional
              media thin-ideal images. Participants completed questionnaires
              assessing pre- and post- image exposure measures of thin-ideal
              internalisation, appearance comparison, self-esteem, Facebook use
              and eating disorder risk. RESULTS: Type of exposure was not found
              to moderate the relationship between appearance comparison and
              changes in body image dissatisfaction. When analysed according to
              exposure type, appearance comparison only significantly predicted
              body image dissatisfaction change for those exposed to Facebook,
              but not conventional media. Facebook use was found to predict
              higher baseline body image dissatisfaction and was associated
              with higher eating disorder risk. CONCLUSIONS: The findings
              suggest the importance of extending the body image
              dissatisfaction literature by taking into account emerging social
              media formats. It is recommended that interventions for body
              image dissatisfaction and eating disorders consider appearance
              comparison processes elicited by thin-ideal content on social

              Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire (SATAQ).
              METHOD: Two independent samples of college females completed a
              revision and extension of the SATAQ and factor analyses were
              conducted to determine the underlying structure of the revised
              scale. RESULTS: Factor analyses indicated two distinct
              internalization factors: one appeared to reflect a generic media
              influence related to TV, magazines, and movies. A second factor
              clearly reflected internalization of athletic and sports figures.
              Two other factors, reflecting media pressures and media as an
              informational source, also emerged. Another widely used measure
              of thin-ideal internalization, the Ideal Body Internalization
              Scale-Revised (IBIS-R), was included in factor analyses to
              determine its empirical relationship with the revised SATAQ. None

              4 U.S. and 3 international female samples, as well as a U.S. male

  abstract = "Participants in the sport of bodybuilding are judged by
              appearance rather than performance. In this respect, increased
              muscle size and definition are critical elements of success. The
              purpose of this review is to evaluate the literature and provide
              recommendations regarding macronutrient intake during both
              'off-season' and 'pre-contest' phases. Body builders attempt to
              increase muscle mass during the off-season (no competitive
              events), which may be the great majority of the year. During the
              off-season, it is advantageous for the bodybuilder to be in
              positive energy balance so that extra energy is available for
              muscle anabolism. Additionally, during the off-season, adequate
              protein must be available to provide amino acids for protein
              synthesis. For 6-12 weeks prior to competition, body builders
              attempt to retain muscle mass and reduce body fat to very low
              levels. During the pre-contest phase, the bodybuilder should be
              in negative energy balance so that body fat can be oxidised.
              Furthermore, during the pre-contest phase, protein intake must be
              adequate to maintain muscle mass. There is evidence that a
              relatively high protein intake (approximately 30\% of energy
              intake) will reduce lean mass loss relative to a lower protein
              intake (approximately 15\% of energy intake) during energy
              restriction. The higher protein intake will also provide a
              relatively large thermic effect that may aid in reducing body
              fat. In both the off-season and pre-contest phases, adequate
              dietary carbohydrate should be ingested (55-60\% of total energy
              intake) so that training intensity can be maintained. Excess
              dietary saturated fat can exacerbate coronary artery disease;
              however, low-fat diets result in a reduction in circulating
              testosterone. Thus, we suggest dietary fats comprise 15-20\% of

              of protein/amino acids and carbohydrate immediately before and
              after training sessions may augment protein synthesis, muscle
              glycogen resynthesis and reduce protein degradation. The optimal
              rate of carbohydrate ingested immediately after a training
              session should be 1.2 g/kg/hour at 30-minute intervals for 4
              hours and the carbohydrate should be of high glycaemic index. In
              summary, the composition of diets for body builders should be
              55-60\% carbohydrate, 25-30\% protein and 15-20\% of fat, for
              both the off-season and pre-contest phases. During the off-season
              the diet should be slightly hyperenergetic (approximately 15\%
              increase in energy intake) and during the pre-contest phase the
              diet should be hypoenergetic (approximately 15\% decrease in

              indicates that hope can serve as a sustaining and motivating
              factor when facing difficult working contexts. Further, a large
              body of research consistently confirms the importance of hope in
              the human change process, both for clients and clinicians. The
              current study investigated how reintegration counsellors fostered
              and maintained hope in their work, including their personal
              descriptions of hope. Employing Merriam's (2002) basic
              interpretive inquiry, five reintegration counsellors participated
              in semi-structured interviews about their work experiences.
              Thematic analysis indicated that hope played an important role in

              linked to disruptions in family functioning. The present study
              utilized a path model analysis to examine the associations

              family functioning and parent-offspring relationships in 150
              adult-aged children of hoarders who responded to online requests

              assisting in hoarding behaviors) would be associated with

               impairment for both sufferers and their relatives. The level of
               carer burden experienced by HD relatives was comparable to or
               greater than that reported in the literature by relatives of

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Until recently, hoarding was considered an
               obsessive-compulsive symptom (OCS). However, current evidence
               suggests that these two phenotypes may be clinically, and
               perhaps etiologically, distinct. Both hoarding and OCS have a
               genetic etiology, but the degree of unique and shared genetic
               contributions to these phenotypes has not been well studied.
               METHOD: Prevalence rates were assessed for hoarding and OCS in a
               sample of adult twin pairs (n = 7906 twins) and their family
               members from The Netherlands Twin Register (total sample =
               15,914). Using Mplus, genetic analyses using liability threshold
               models were conducted for both phenotypes, for their
               co-morbidity, and for specific hoarding symptoms (cluttering,
               discarding and acquiring). RESULTS: Of the total sample, 6.7\%
               met criteria for clinically significant hoarding; endorsement of
               all three hoarding symptoms was > or = 79\%. Men had slightly
               higher rates than women. Also, 5.7\% met criteria for clinically
               significant OCS; rates were similar in males and females.
               Genetic factors accounted for 36\% of the variance for hoarding
               and 40\% of the variance for OCS. The genetic correlation
               between hoarding and OCS was 0.10. There was no evidence of
               sex-specific genetic contributions for hoarding or OCS. There
               was evidence for a genetic contribution to all hoarding symptom
               subtypes. Only cluttering showed evidence of a contribution from
               the shared environment. CONCLUSIONS: OCS and hoarding are common
               in this population-based sample, have prevalence rates similar
               to those previously reported, and show significant heritability.
               Genetic factors contributed to the co-morbidity of both traits,
               although the genetic correlation between them was low.",

               number of families engaging in behaviors and modifying family
               routines in response to the youth's OCD symptoms. Family
               accommodation is commonly considered as a unidimensional
               construct, resulting in limited research on the phenomenological
               aspects of family accommodation and how different facets (i.e.,
               participation, modification, and distress/consequences) may
               impact pediatric OCD. As such, the present study sought to
               examine the extent to which family accommodation, as a whole and
               within subtypes, was related to OCD symptom severity and symptom
               dimensions, youth clinical characteristics (i.e.,
               internalizing/externalizing symptoms, depressive symptoms), and
               family factors (i.e., cohesion and conflict). Family
               accommodation was related to OCD symptom severity and the
               contamination symptom dimension, youth depressive symptoms (but
               not the participation domain), and youth
               internalizing/externalizing symptoms. Youth externalizing
               symptoms mediated the relationship between OCD symptom severity
               and family accommodation. After controlling for OCD symptom

               accommodation in general, as well as the distress/consequences

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Previous research suggests that hoarding aggregates
               in families and is associated with health and safety risks and
               family problems. The present study examined gender- and
               diagnosis-related differences in reports of hoarding symptoms
               among first-degree relatives of people who hoard, and of
               clinical and community samples. METHODS: The present study
               included 443 participants in a study of hoarding behavior: 217
               with hoarding disorder (HD), 96 with obsessive-compulsive
               disorder (OCD), and 130 nonclinical community controls (CC).
               Assessment included a detailed interview of familial patterns of
               hoarding behaviors among parents and siblings and measures of
               hoarding severity. RESULTS: In the combined sample, participants
               reported more hoarding among female (mothers, sisters) than male
               (fathers, brothers) relatives. Significantly more female than
               male participants indicated they had a parent or any
               first-degree relative with hoarding behaviors. However, within
               the HD sample no significant gender effects were found for
               household, safety, and functioning variables, or for hoarding
               symptom severity. In an age- and gender-matched subsample (total
               n = 150), HD participants reported more hallmark hoarding
               symptoms (difficulty discarding and saving/clutter), and
               acquiring among their relatives compared to OCD and CC samples,
               and parents had higher rates than siblings. CONCLUSIONS:
               Hoarding symptoms appear to be common among first-degree
               relatives of people who hoard and are also found among relatives
               of control samples. The predominance of hoarding symptoms among
               female relatives may indicate genetic or modeling transmission
               but this requires further study using large twin samples.
               Clinicians should consider that family members may also have
               significant hoarding symptoms.",

               dysfunction and burden on family members. Currently, little is
               known about the effect that family members have on individuals'
               hoarding symptoms and functioning, and vice versa. The present
               study examined the nature and frequency of accommodation in
               hoarding. Fifty-two individuals with self-reported hoarding
               problems and their close significant others (CSOs) completed the
               Family Accommodation Interview for Hoarding (FAI-H), which was
               adapted from a previously validated measure for this study, and
               a series of self-report questionnaires. The FAI-H was found to
               be a reliable and valid measure of accommodation in problem
               hoarding. CSOs who lived with the individual with the hoarding
               problem reported engaging in accommodating behaviors more
               frequently than those who did not live with the individual.
               Accommodation was positively associated with hoarding symptom
               severity, relationship functioning, and CSOs' rejecting
               attitudes toward the individual with hoarding problems, and it
               partially mediated the association between hoarding symptom
               severity and relationship conflict. These results inform our
               understanding of accommodation and interpersonal processes in

              criteria for HD, 55 relatives of individuals meeting criteria for
              HD, and comparison groups of 51 self-identified collectors and 25
              relatives of collectors. All participants completed a
              clinician-administered diagnostic interview for HD and an online
              battery of standardized measures of health, well-being, and
              impairment. RESULTS: Substantial functional impairment was found
              for both HD individuals and their relatives. HD relatives
              reported significantly greater carer burden and accommodation of
              hoarding behaviors than relatives of collectors. Perceived level
              of squalor, co-habiting with, and increasing age of the HD
              individual were significant predictors of carer burden and
              functional impairment in the relatives. LIMITATIONS: The use of
              self-identified HD individuals may have produced a bias towards
              participants with relatively good insight. Subjective biases in
              self-reported symptoms cannot be ruled out, although the use of
              informant-report data provided some independent validation.
              CONCLUSIONS: HD is associated with substantial functional
              impairment for both sufferers and their relatives. The level of
              carer burden experienced by HD relatives was comparable to or
              greater than that reported in the literature by relatives of
              individuals with dementia. The findings indicate that relatives
              of individuals with HD may benefit from increased support and
              suggest that it may be beneficial to involve family members in
              the treatment of HD.",

              functioning as family members modify their personal and family
              routines, participate in rituals, and provide reassurance. These
              behaviors have been identified as family accommodation (FA), a
              phenomenon that, if ignored, may facilitate OCD symptoms and lead
              to poorer prognosis. Because FA has been recognized as a
              predictor of treatment outcome, we examined the prevalence of FA
              and identified patient and family sociodemographic and clinical
              variables associated with FA in an outpatient sample. METHODS:
              The study comprised 228 subjects, namely, 114 patients with OCD
              and 114 family members, assessed before the patients entered a
              12-session cognitive behavioral group therapy program. A
              multivariate linear regression model was used to control for
              confounding factors and to evaluate variables independently
              associated with FA. FA was evaluated using the Family
              Accommodation Scale for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder-Interviewer
              Rated. RESULTS: FA was found to be highly prevalent among family
              members. Two patient factors positively associated with FA were
              OCD severity as measured by the Clinical Global Impressions Scale
              and higher scores on the Obsessions dimension of the
              Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised. Family members'
              characteristics that were positively associated with FA were
              higher scores on the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory - Revised
              hoarding subscale and being the patient's spouse. CONCLUSION: Our
              findings suggest that the early identification of patients and
              family members who could benefit from interventions aimed at
              reducing FA could improve treatment outcomes.",

               been made toward ``looking under the hood'' of MI to understand

               Such specification of outcome-relevant aspects of practice is

               delivery and clinical training. An emergent theory of MI is

              nonclinical sample of male bodybuilders. Design A cross-sectional
              study was conducted with a sample of 100 male bodybuilders.
              Methods Participants completed a questionnaire battery consisting
              of the muscle dysmorphic inventory (MDI), and scales on childhood
              bullying victimization, self-esteem, and psychological problems
              including depression, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive (OC)
              symptoms. Results High scores on the MDI and bullying
              victimization in childhood predicted global psychopathology and
              low self-esteem. Psychological functioning and self-esteem were
              most strongly adversely affected if the men were victims of
              bullying and scored high on the MDI (significant moderation
              effect). Structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses furthermore
              found an indirect linkage of victimization with global
              psychopathology and self-esteem via MDI (mediation effect).

              disorder assessments traditionally have measured a finite number
              of specific eating-disordered thoughts or actions. The current
              work presents a new instrument, the Yale-Brown-Cornell Eating
              Disorder Scale (YBC-EDS), that does not limit assessment to a
              particular set of eating-related concerns or behaviors. Rather,
              it assesses the severity of illness associated with an
              individual's unique symptomatology. Reliability and validity of
              this new, clinician-rated instrument was tested in two
              independent samples of DSM-III-R eating disorder patients. The
              YBC-EDS eight-item scale assessing severity of preoccupations and
              rituals, and a set of six provisional items for assessing
              motivation for change were both frequently endorsed and found to
              have excellent interrater reliability. Internal consistency was
              shown to be good for the set of eight core items and the set of
              six items related to motivation for change. The eight-item scale

              METHODS: We searched Medline and Pubmed using several key terms
              relating to orthorexia nervosa (ON) and checked the reference
              list of the articles that we found. Attention was given to
              methodological problems in these studies, such as the use of

              population and 35-57.8 \% for high-risk groups (healthcare

  abstract = "CONTEXT: Research has suggested that the prevalence of young
              women with eating disorders (EDs) is increasing, but determining
              the exact prevalence of EDs within the female student-athlete
              (FS-A) population is difficult. Looking at certain traits may
              help us to identify their level of susceptibility to developing
              an ED. OBJECTIVE: To determine the susceptibility of FS-As to EDs
              in relation to self-concept, including self-esteem and body
              image. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Athletic training
              and health centers at National Collegiate Athletic Association
              Division I, II, and III institutions via e-mail questionnaire
              correspondence. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A total of 439
              FS-As from 17 participating institutions completed the
              questionnaires. The sample was primarily white (83.1\%) and
              underclass (61.8\%). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The questionnaire
              consisted of 4 parts: 3 subscales of the Eating Disorder
              Inventory-2, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, the Body Cathexis
              Scale, and demographic items. RESULTS: A total of 6.8\% of FS-As
              were susceptible to anorexia and 1.8\% were susceptible to
              bulimia. The majority of FS-As (61\%) reported normal self-esteem
              levels, whereas 29.4\% had high self-esteem. Overall, 64.5\% were
              satisfied and 23\% were very satisfied with their body image.
              CONCLUSIONS: These results are generally positive in that they
              suggest FS-As have high levels of self-concept and are at low
              risk to develop EDs. However, these findings do not mean that all
              concerns should be dismissed. Although more than 90\% of the
              respondents were not susceptible to an ED, there are still FS-As
              who may be. Athletic departments should evaluate their FS-As'
              levels of self-concept so that their susceptibility to EDs can be
              addressed. The emotional aspect of health care should be included
              in providing holistic care for student-athletes. Athletic
              trainers often are the primary health care providers for FS-As,
              so they should be made aware of this concern.",

              obsessive-compulsive personality. The study is a cross-sectional
              research, which reached out to the entire 318 MD. The ORTO-15

              verify the prevalence of ON. Those subjects who were classified
              below 40 from the ORTO-15 test are accepted to have ON.
              Chi-square test, ANOVA (univariate) analysis and logistic
              regression were used for analyses of the data. Mean score of the
              participants from the ORTO-15 test is 39.8+/-0.22, and there is
              no statistical difference between women and men. A total of
              45.5\% of the residence MD involved in the research scored below
              40 in the ORTO-15 test. Those who do their food shopping
              themselves, skip a meal with a salad/fruit, care about the
              quality of the things they eat, think that eating outside is
              healthy, look at the content of what they eat and the content of
              food is important in selection of a product score lower in their
              average marks in ORTO-15 and the difference among the groups is
              statistically significant. Food selection of 20.1\% of the male
              participants and 38.9\% of the female participants among the
              residence MD is influenced by the programs on nutrition/health in
              mass-media. The difference between the groups is statistically
              significant (p<0.05). Female medical doctors are more careful
              than men of their physical appearance and weight control and
              consume less caloric food, which is statistically significant.
              Since those who exhibit ``healthy fanatic'' eating habits may
              have a risk of ON in the future, it would be useful to conduct
              studies that identify the prevalence of ON in the public.",

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Orthorexia nervosa (Greek: ortho--correct, right;
              orexis--appetite, desire) is a term introduced in 1997 by the
              American doctor Steven Bratman and is defined as a pathological
              fixation with righteous and healthy eating. Clear classification
              criteria oforthorexia have not been developed yet and there has
              been an on-going discussion whether it belongs to the group of
              eating disorders or the obsessive-compulsive disorders. AIM: The
              aim of this paper is to summarise briefly the current state of
              knowledge regarding orthorexia and to point out the difficulties
              connected with an attempt to classify it in a given disorders
              group as well as with the attempt to establish the classification
              criteria. DISCUSSION: Despite the fact that the problem of
              orthorexia has been signalled in the Polish media, it has neither
              been discussed nor published in the Polish medical literature
              yet. Orthorexia starts when a diet becomes an escape from
              life--everyday activities are dominated by planning, buying and
              preparing ``proper'' meals. Each departure from this regime
              causes anxiety and guilty conscience and leads to even further
              tightening of the dietary habits. According to Bratmann,
              orthorexia is connected with an illusory feeling of safety
              (preventing from diseases), the urge to exercise a full control
              over one's life (elimination of the unpredictable), ``a hidden
              conformism'' (eating philosophy helps in a subconscious way to
              achieve a culturally accepted model of a beautiful body), a
              search for spirituality and identity, and a desire for
              self-deprivation. CONCLUSIONS: The arguments presented in this
              paper substantiate the expediency of implementing the
              epidemiological studies which will show the scale of the problem,
              its prevalence and conditionings. Data obtained in this way
              should facilitate the verification of classification criteria and
              will also help to formulate the diagnostic criteria of
              orthorexia.",

              The study covered 1899 pupils of secondary schools. The OCD and

              factors of ON - OCD and ON - ED indicated the higher the
              probability of diagnosis of these disorders, the higher the
              probability of ON diagnosis, too. The compatibility of ON and OCD
              diagnoses was for ON-40 = 45.8\% and ON-35, 76.5\%. It was shown
              that the OCD increases the risk of ON at the threshold value ON =

              ON-40, 42.7\% and ON-35, 84.4\%. The analysis of various
              variables confirmed a significant dependency of ON from ED, which
              suggests that ON belongs to ED. The diagnostic accuracy in this
              case is better at the threshold value ON- 35. Conclusions The

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Sometimes the suspicion is put forward that nutrition
              students show more disordered eating patterns, which may be among
              the motivating factors to study nutrition. At the same time, it
              is not clear whether the students' increasing knowledge about
              diet and nutrition is associated with a more healthy eating
              behaviour or with an unhealthy obsession with food choices.
              DESIGN: Cross-sectional comparison of nutrition students from
              German universities during the first year of their studies (n
              123) and during higher semesters (n 96), with a control group
              from other study programmes (n 68 and n 46, respectively).
              Dietary restraint, disinhibition, the tendency towards orthorexia
              nervosa and healthy food choices were assessed using a
              questionnaire. RESULTS: Nutrition students showed higher levels
              of dietary restraint than the control group. Disinhibition and
              orthorexia nervosa did not differ between nutrition students and
              controls. Orthorexic tendencies were lower in the more advanced
              nutrition students. Healthy food choices did not differ among
              students in the first year. More advanced nutrition students
              showed healthier food choices, whereas the corresponding controls
              showed slightly more unhealthy food choices. CONCLUSIONS:
              Nutrition students, more than other students, tend to restrict
              their food intake in order to control their weight, but they do
              not have more disturbed or disordered eating patterns than other
              students. Moreover, during the course of their studies, they
              adopt slightly more healthy food choices and decrease their
              tendency to be obsessive in their eating behaviour.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Orthorexia is a pathological fixation about the
              consumption of healthy food. The present study aimed to reveal
              the psychometric properties of the Turkish version of ORTO-15,

              the relationship betweenorthorexia, and eating attitude,
              obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and some demographic variables.
              METHOD: The study included 994 participants aged between 19 and
              66 years. ORTO-15, the Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory,
              and the Eating Attitude Test-40 were administered to the
              participants. RESULTS: A 3-factor solution with varimax rotation
              explained 40.62\% of the variance. When 4 items with factor
              loadings below+/- 0.50 were eliminated from ORTO-15, the
              Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.62. The remaining 11 items
              were thought to have statistically satisfactory properties for
              the Turkish version of ORTO and were collectively referred to as
              ORTO-11. This version was used to investigate the relationship
              between orthorexia, and eating attitude and obsessive-compulsive
              symptoms. Pathological eating attitude and obsessive-compulsive
              symptoms were related to orthorexia. Women exhibited more
              orthorexic symptoms then men. In the present study high a body
              mass index was an important variable for orthorexia, but only
              together with gender (female), pathological eating attitude, and
              increased obsessive-compulsive symptoms. The results,
              implications, and limitations of the study are discussed.
              CONCLUSION: ORTO-11 demonstrated statistically satisfactory
              properties. Orthorexia was related to pathological eating
              attitude and obsessive-compulsive symptoms; however, caution
              should be used when generalizing the reported results.",

              well documented. Government policy in Scotland recommends
              reducing salt, refined sugar and saturated fat in the diet and
              increasing the consumption of fruit and vegetables,
              carbohydrates, fibre and oily fish. METHODS: Using data from the
              1998 Scottish Health Survey a composite measure of healthy eating
              behaviour was derived by scoring low levels of consumption of
              salt, refined sugar and saturated fat and higher consumption of
              fruit and vegetables, carbohydrates, fibre and oily fish. This
              paper presents results from logistic regression analysis of the
              risk factors for this measure of healthy eating behaviour.
              RESULTS: Young people, men, those on low income, those without

              Procedures (IRAPs) to examine their implicit beliefs concerning
              actual (e.g., I am thin) and desired ideal body image (e.g., I
              want to be thin). Body dissatisfaction was examined via
              self-report questionnaires and rating scales. As expected,
              differences in body dissatisfaction exerted a differential
              influence on the two IRAP scores. Specifically, the implicit

              exhibited a low degree of body dissatisfaction. In contrast, the

              of the first 600 APrON women. Supplemental nutrient intake and
              symptoms of depression (measured with the Edinburgh Postnatal
              Depression Scale (EPDS)) were collected at each trimester and 12
              weeks postpartum. RESULTS: Of the 475 participants who completed
              the EPDS at least twice in pregnancy and at 12 weeks postpartum,
              416 (88\%) scored <10 and 59 (12\%) scored $\geq$10, where an
              EPDS $\geq$10 is considered to be ``at least probable minor

              in women with lower EPDS scores, particularly selenium (p =
              0.0015) and omega-3s (p = 0.01). Bivariate analyses showed that
              several demographic and social/lifestyle variables were
              associated with EPDS $\geq$10: not having been born in Canada (p
              = 0.01), greater number of chronic conditions (p = 0.05), greater
              number of stressful life events during this pregnancy (p = 0.02),
              and lower prenatal and postnatal support (p = 0.0043 and p =
              0.0001, respectively). Adjusting for covariates and nutrients
              known to be associated with postpartum depression, logistic
              regression showed that having a prenatal EPDS $\geq$ 10 increased
              the odds of postpartum depressive symptoms (second and third
              trimester OR = 3.29, 95\% CI = 1.55 - 7.01, p = 0.004 and OR =

              Multiple factors, including supplementary selenium intake, are
              associated with the risk of postpartum depressive symptoms.

  abstract = "Dieting is an important risk factor for disordered eating and
              eating disorders. Disordered eating occurs on a continuum from
              dieting and restrictive eating, abnormal eating behavior, and
              finally clinical eating disorders. The prevalence of eating
              disorders is increased in elite athletes and for this group the
              cause of starting to diet is related to (a) perception of the
              paradigm of appearance in the specific sport, (b) perceived
              performance improvements, and (c) sociocultural pressures for
              thinness or an ``ideal'' body. Athletes most at risk for
              disordered eating are those involved in sports emphasizing a thin
              body size/shape, a high power-to-weight ratio, and/or sports
              utilizing weight categories, such as in some high-intensity
              sports. In addition to dieting, personality factors, pressure to
              lose weight, frequent weight cycling, early start of
              sport-specific training, overtraining, injuries, and unfortunate
              coaching behavior, are important risk factors. To prevent
              disordered eating and eating disorders, the athletes have to
              practice healthy eating, and the medical staff of teams and
              parents must be able to recognize symptoms indicating risk for
              eating disorders. Coaches and leaders must accept that disordered
              eating can be a problem in the athletic community and that
              openness regarding this challenge is important.",

              increasingly stressful for students in higher education, but
              there is limited research about the extent to which those
              attending student counselling services experience difficulties
              relating to academic issues and how effective counselling is for
              them. Aim The study aimed to evaluate the reliable and clinically
              significant change for students with self-reported academic
              issues. Reliable change occurs when a change in the outcome being
              measured is not attributable to error, while clinically
              significant change occurs when a person moves from a clinical
              population to a healthy population after an intervention, in this
              case counselling. Methodology Pre-existing data from 129
              university students who had attended a student counselling
              service were analysed to determine levels of reliable change and
              clinically significant change. These data related to
              psychological status before and after counselling based on
              CORE-OM total scores; self-report of the impact of counselling on
              academic issues; and demographic variables. Findings In total,
              117 (92\%) of students reported experiencing academic issues to
              some extent. Counselling was found to result in reliable change
              for 67\% and clinically significant change for 40\% of those
              students reporting academic issues. Implications The results of
              the study suggest that, even where academic reasons are not the
              primary cause of referral to student counselling services, a
              significant number of students will also experience difficulties
              in these areas. Counselling was, however, shown to result in

              but the potential benefits of this are unclear. OBJECTIVE: To
              evaluate the potential benefits of depression screening in
              patients with cardiovascular disease by assessing (1) the
              accuracy of depression screening instruments; (2) the effect of
              depression treatment on depression and cardiac outcomes; and (3)
              the effect of screening on depression and cardiac outcomes in
              patients in cardiovascular care settings. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE,
              PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, ISI, SCOPUS, and Cochrane databases
              from inception to May 1, 2008; manual journal searches; reference
              list reviews; and citation tracking of included articles. STUDY
              SELECTION: We included articles in any language about patients in
              cardiovascular care settings that (1) compared a screening
              instrument to a valid major depressive disorder criterion
              standard; (2) compared depression treatment with placebo or usual
              care in a randomized controlled trial; or (3) assessed the effect
              of screening on depression identification and treatment rates,
              depression, or cardiac outcomes. DATA EXTRACTION: Methodological
              characteristics and outcomes were extracted by 2 investigators.
              RESULTS: We identified 11 studies about screening accuracy, 6
              depression treatment trials, but no studies that evaluated the
              effects of screening on depression or cardiovascular outcomes. In
              studies that tested depression screening instruments using a
              priori-defined cutoff scores, sensitivity ranged from 39\% to
              100\% (median, 84\%) and specificity ranged from 58\% to 94\%
              (median, 79\%). Depression treatment with medication or cognitive
              behavioral therapy resulted in modest reductions in depressive
              symptoms (effect size, 0.20-0.38; r(2), 1\%-4\%). There was no
              evidence that depression treatment improved cardiac outcomes.
              Among patients with depression and history of myocardial
              infarction in the ENRICHD trial, there was no difference in
              event-free survival between participants treated with cognitive
              behavioral therapy supplemented by an antidepressant vs usual
              care (75.5\% vs 74.7\%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Depression
              treatment with medication or cognitive behavioral therapy in
              patients with cardiovascular disease is associated with modest
              improvement in depressive symptoms but no improvement in cardiac
              outcomes. No clinical trials have assessed whether screening for
              depression improves depressive symptoms or cardiac outcomes in
              patients with cardiovascular disease.",

  abstract = "Disordered eating is prevalent among college student populations,
              and Orthorexia Nervosa (ON) is being explored as a new type of
              eating disorder. There is currently no standardized ON diagnostic
              tool, and the majority of ON research has been conducted among
              European populations. The present study explored the Bratman
              Orthorexia Test (BOT) for ON diagnosis, and its relationship to
              validated tools for assessing disordered eating, body dysmorphic,
              and obsessive-compulsive tendencies among college students
              attending a western university. A convenience sample of 448
              college students with a mean age of 22 years was recruited to
              complete an online survey that included the BOT, Eating Attitudes
              Test-26 (EAT-26), Body Dysmorphic Disorder Questionnaire (BDDQ),
              Obsessive Compulsive Inventory, Revised (OCI-R) and demographics.
              Spearman correlation, Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis, chi-square,
              and multiple linear regressions were used for analyses. The
              average BOT score was 4.71, near the ``health fanatic'' range,
              with Hispanic/Latino subjects and overweight/obese students
              having significantly higher median BOT scores. Gender, age, and
              college major were not significantly associated with BOT score.
              Significant positive correlations were observed between total BOT
              and EAT-26 scores (r=.47, p<0.01), BOT and BDDQ scores (r=.25,
              p<0.01), and BOT and OCI-R scores (r=.19, p<0.01). ON tendencies
              may exist among college students and Hispanic/Latino and
              overweight/obese students may be at increased risk. Further
              research is needed to determine ON risk factors among diverse

              approaches on college campuses.",

              health care providers use or are interested in using
              complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). People around the
              world rely on CAM, so similar issues face clinicians in many
              countries. In law, few cases have dealt with CAM use. The few
              that have apply the same general legal principles used in cases
              that involved conventional care while taking into account
              considerations unique to CAM. In ethics, as with conventional
              care, the issues surrounding pediatric CAM use usually involve
              questions about who the appropriate decision-makers are, on what
              ethical principles should clinical decision-making rely, and what
              obligations arise on the part of physicians and other health care
              providers. Clinical decision-making is made more complex by the
              relatively limited research on the efficacy and safety of CAM

              individuals modify their emotional experiences, expressions, and
              physiology and the situations eliciting such emotions in order to
              produce appropriate responses to the ever-changing demands posed
              by the environment. Thus, context plays a central role in emotion
              regulation. This is particularly relevant to the work on emotion
              regulation in psychopathology, because psychological disorders
              are characterized by rigid responses to the environment. However,
              this recognition of the importance of context has appeared
              primarily in the theoretical realm, with the empirical work
              lagging behind. In this review, the author proposes an approach
              to systematically evaluate the contextual factors shaping emotion
              regulation. Such an approach consists of specifying the
              components that characterize emotion regulation and then
              systematically evaluating deviations within each of these
              components and their underlying dimensions. Initial guidelines

              the dispensing of pediatric ADs using provincial,
              population-based data from Canada. METHODS: Data covering 22 ADs
              were drawn from the Saskatchewan Ministry of Health
              administrative data files in outpatient settings. The data were
              for 9 triennial years from 1983 to 2007, a 24-year period, for
              those aged 0 to 19 in the general population. Descriptive
              analyses were used. RESULTS: In 1983, 5.9 per 1000 population
              aged 0 to 19 were dispensed at least 1 AD; this decreased to 5.1
              per 1000 population in 1989, and then increased to 15.4 per 1000
              population in 2007, with a slower increase after 2004. Both sexes
              were dispensed more ADs from 1989 onwards, with females being the
              heavier users. The rate of AD use increased significantly with
              age, and this trend became more pronounced after 1998. Family
              physicians were the major prescribers and their prescriptions
              significantly increased from 1989 to 2004 and decreased in 2007.
              The use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) was
              the major reason for the increase. The number of AD scripts per
              patient also increased. CONCLUSIONS: The growth in the prevalence
              of AD use among children and youth was largely caused by the use
              of SSRIs. The possibility of safety issues induced by AD use
              among children and adolescents, and different patterns of
              medication practice, suggest continuing education is warranted.",

  abstract = "The person-centred approach based on the work of Carl Rogers
              (1902--1987) was designed to promote openness, growth and change
              in understanding the counseling processes. It is an approach
              which is practical and helpful in education, because it can solve
              some of the problems outside the curriculum faced by students.
              For example it provides a way of understanding and solving issues
              of relationships, emotional development and ethical behaviour
              that seem to be at the root of most of the problems in school and
              society at large. However, it is essential to incorporate some
              accelerating ingredients to inform conditions which facilitate
              growth. These include acceptance, empathy and positive regard
              from others. For example it has been realized that if an
              individual is denied acceptance and positive regard they fail to
              relate the meaning of their experience to themselves and positive
              growth in such a relevant way is inhibited. However, the approach
              is faced with some drawbacks which will be explored. Teaching
              today in British schools is a very challenging job. It is
              becoming increasingly difficult to establish a classroom
              environment that is free from disruptive behaviour. The
              person-centred approach, where the student as the client is made
              responsible of his or her own behaviour, could be part of the
              solution. This could be the focus of an educational yet assertive
              discipline program. This paper will discuss the person-centred
              approach in counseling touching on the process of the helping
              relationship, empathy, congruence, unconditional positive regard
              as important concepts of the approach and some suggestions on

               findings concerning possible cognitive and emotional deficits

               data on normative brain development. The second was to utilize
               this framework of normative brain development to interpret
               changes in developmental trajectories associated with deficits

               used to discuss behavioral and neural sequelae of ELS. Early
               adversity was found to be associated with deficits in a range of
               cognitive (cognitive performance, memory, and executive
               functioning) and affective (reward processing, processing of
               social and affective stimuli, and emotion regulation) functions.
               CONCLUSION: Three general conclusions emerge: (1) higher-order,
               complex cognitive and affective functions associated with brain
               regions undergoing protracted postnatal development are
               particularly vulnerable to the deleterious effects of ELS; (2)
               the amygdala is particularly sensitive to early ELS; and (3)
               several deficits, particularly those in the affective domain,
               appear to persist years after ELS has ceased and may increase
               risk for later psychopathology.",

               affecting children and adolescents. Although cognitive
               behavioral therapy and selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors
               have shown efficacy in treating these disorders, little is known
               about their relative or combined efficacy. METHODS: In this
               randomized, controlled trial, we assigned 488 children between
               the ages of 7 and 17 years who had a primary diagnosis of
               separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or
               social phobia to receive 14 sessions of cognitive behavioral
               therapy, sertraline (at a dose of up to 200 mg per day), a
               combination of sertraline and cognitive behavioral therapy, or a
               placebo drug for 12 weeks in a 2:2:2:1 ratio. We administered
               categorical and dimensional ratings of anxiety severity and
               impairment at baseline and at weeks 4, 8, and 12. RESULTS: The
               percentages of children who were rated as very much or much
               improved on the Clinician Global Impression-Improvement scale
               were 80.7\% for combination therapy (P<0.001), 59.7\% for
               cognitive behavioral therapy (P<0.001), and 54.9\% for
               sertraline (P<0.001); all therapies were superior to placebo
               (23.7\%). Combination therapy was superior to both monotherapies
               (P<0.001). Results on the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale
               documented a similar magnitude and pattern of response;
               combination therapy had a greater response than cognitive
               behavioral therapy, which was equivalent to sertraline, and all
               therapies were superior to placebo. Adverse events, including
               suicidal and homicidal ideation, were no more frequent in the
               sertraline group than in the placebo group. No child attempted
               suicide. There was less insomnia, fatigue, sedation, and
               restlessness associated with cognitive behavioral therapy than
               with sertraline. CONCLUSIONS: Both cognitive behavioral therapy
               and sertraline reduced the severity of anxiety in children with
               anxiety disorders; a combination of the two therapies had a
               superior response rate. (ClinicalTrials.gov number,

               principles that included cognitive in addition to behavioral and

               a third wave, including anomalies in the current literature and
               philosophical changes. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)
               is one of a number of new interventions from both behavioral and

               targets these processes and is producing supportive data both at

               characterized by openness to older clinical traditions, a focus
               on second order and contextual change, an emphasis of function
               over form, and the construction of flexible and effective
               repertoires, among other features. They build on the first- and

              and AIATSIS, Blackwell Synergy, CINAHL and Pre CINHAL, Health

              published in peer-reviewed journals, empirical studies that
              considered Indigenous people's understandings of mental health
              and provided details on methodology. Five articles from four
              qualitative studies met these criteria. Meta-ethnography was used
              to identify common themes emerging from the original studies.
              Reciprocal translation was used to synthesize the findings to
              provide new interpretations extending beyond those presented in
              the original studies. An overarching theme emerged from the
              synthesis: the dynamic interconnectedness between the
              multi-factorial components of life circumstances. Reciprocal
              translations and synthesis regarding Indigenous understandings of
              mental health and illness resulted in five themes: (i) culture
              and spirituality; (ii) family and community kinships; (iii)

              small proportion of Aboriginal youth have contact with mental

              or Torres Strait Islander adolescent who is experiencing a mental

              Australian Aboriginal people who are experts in Aboriginal youth
              mental health, participated in a Delphi study investigating how
              members of the public can be culturally appropriate when helping

              health problems. The panel varied in size across the three
              sequential rounds, from 37-41 participants. Panellists were
              presented with statements about cultural considerations and
              communication strategies via online questionnaires and were
              encouraged to suggest additional content. All statements endorsed

              RESULTS: From a total of 304 statements shown to the panel of

  abstract = "Multicultural professional psychologists routinely assert that
              psychotherapeutic interventions require culturally competent
              delivery for ethnoracial minority clients to protect the
              distinctive cultural orientations of these clients. Dominant
              disciplinary conceptualizations of cultural competence are ``kind
              of person'' models that emphasize specialized awareness,
              knowledge, and skills on the part of the practitioner. Even
              within psychology, this approach to cultural competence is
              controversial owing to professional misgivings concerning its
              culturally essentialist assumptions. Unfortunately, alternative
              ``process-oriented'' models of cultural competence emphasize such
              generic aspects of therapeutic interaction that they remain in
              danger of losing sight of culture altogether. Thus, for cultural
              competence to persist as a meaningful construct, an alternative
              approach that avoids both essentialism and generalism must be
              recovered. One means to capture this alternative is to shift
              focus away from culturally competent therapists toward culturally
              commensurate therapies. Indigenous communities in North America
              represent interesting sites for exploring this shift, owing to
              widespread political commitments to Aboriginal cultural
              reclamation in the context of postcoloniality. Two examples from
              indigenous communities illustrate a continuum of cultural
              commensurability that ranges from global psychotherapeutic
              approaches at one end to local healing traditions at the other.
              Location of culturally integrative efforts by indigenous

              local, agentic, and intentional deconstructions and

              psychoanalysis by those who have shifted to relationship or
              so-called two-person psychologies in our field. The author begins
              by briefly describing a parallel to the recent history of
              psychoanalysis in the sudden rise and fall of scholastic
              philosophy in the 14th century. He then focuses on contemporary
              attacks on Freud's psychoanalysis as a science, based on the
              contention by two-person psychologists that free association by
              the patient and evenly hovering attention by the analyst are
              actually impossible. He reviews Freud's idea of psychoanalysis,
              discusses psychodynamic psychotherapy, both conceived as
              scientific treatment procedures, and describes the current
              assault on their metapsychological and epistemological
              foundations. Returning to the parallel between what happened to
              medieval scholasticism and what has happened to psychoanalysis,
              he examines why this happened, and the resulting fragmentation of
              psychoanalytic practice. The article concludes with suggestions
              for the integration of various schools of psychoanalysis,
              reminding us of Benjamin Franklin's warning: ``We must, indeed,

              self-administered, online questionnaire consisting of five
              measures: ORTO-15, the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale

              Scales Questionnaire (RSQ), and Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale
              (RSES). RESULTS: Correlation analysis revealed that higher
              orthorexic tendencies significantly correlated with higher scores
              for perfectionism (self-oriented, others-oriented and socially
              prescribed), appearance orientation, overweight preoccupation,
              self-classified weight, and fearful and dismissing attachment
              styles. Higher orthorexic tendencies also correlated with lower
              scores for body areas satisfaction and a secure attachment style.
              There was no significant correlation between orthorexia nervosa
              and self-esteem. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed
              that overweight preoccupation, appearance orientation and the

              predictors of orthorexia nervosa with a history of an eating

              attachment style. In addition, a history of an eating disorder
              strongly predicts orthorexia nervosa. These findings suggest that

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The pursuit for healthy food consumption is
              considered a laudable habit. This attitude can turn into
              pathological when cognitions and worries about healthy nutrition
              lead to such an accurate food selection that correct diet becomes
              the most important part of one's own life leading to important
              dietary restrictions, stereotyped eating or impairment in
              important areas of functioning. This behaviour is coined
              orthorexia nervosa (ON) and can share common characteristics with
              anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN). The purpose of
              the present study was to examine the frequency of ON among women
              with eating disorders (EDs) and to evaluate if it changed after
              treating the ED. METHODS: Thirty-two patients with AN or BN were
              evaluated by means of the ORTO-15, the Yale-Brown-Cornell Eating
              Disorder Scale (YBC-EDS) and the Eating Attitude Test (EAT-26)
              before (t0) and 3 years after the treatment of their ED (t1), and
              compared to 32 female healthy controls (HC) matched by gender,
              age, and BMI at t1. RESULTS: A significantly higher percentage of
              patients either at t0 (28 \%) or t1 (58 \%) resulted positive to
              ORTO-15 compared to controls (6 \%). YBC-EDS and EAT-26 scores
              were higher among ED patients than in HC, but they decreased from
              t0 to t1. CONCLUSIONS: Orthorexia nervosa symptoms are highly
              prevalent among patients with AN and BN, and tend to increase
              after treatment. ON seems associated both with the clinical
              improvement of AN and BN and the migration towards less severe
              forms of EDs. It is necessary to clarify if ON residual
              symptomatology can be responsible for a greater number of
              relapses and recurrences of EDs.",

              quality. Bratman (1997) coined the term ``orthorexia nervosa'' to

              fear of `over-foreignisation'. Central to this development are
              discourses of difference in which Swiss culture is centred and
              foreign ones are marginalised. At present, Eastern and South-East
              European cultures are particularly affected. In this article, we
              challenge perceived cultural incommensurability by examining the
              socialisation of second-generation girls of immigrant background,
              through data generated from semi-structured interviews with them.
              The girls draw on a tightly defined discursive range of
              linguistic resources to construct the meanings of sport, health
              and the body. Specifically, the girls refer to healthism, within
              which sport is seen to provide a means to achieve good health and
              a slim and feminine body. These references reflect a set of
              knowledge and discourses important to Western cultures.
              Alternative discursive resources exist, yet were not utilised. We
              argue that the girls' adoption of healthist ideas is used to
              counter cultural narratives---such as the uncultured, and thus
              non-integrated, immigrant---and that this adoption supports and

              highlighting the role of pride in maintaining eating disordered
              behaviours. Despite its clinical importance, there are no

              psychopathology. This study describes the development and
              validation of the Pride in Eating Pathology Scale (PEP-S), a
              self-report questionnaire that examines feelings of pride towards
              eating disordered symptoms (e.g., pride in food restriction,
              thinness and weight loss). Participants were 390 females,
              recruited from university and community populations, whose mean
              age was 26.99 years. Respondents rated pride in eating pathology
              on a 7-point Likert-scale. Principal Component Analysis indicated
              that the 60-item scale comprised a four component structure: (1)
              pride in weight loss, food control and thinness, (2) pride in
              healthy weight and healthy eating, (3) pride in outperforming
              others and social recognition and (4) pride in capturing other
              people's attention due to extreme thinness. These four components
              explained a total of 65.31\% of the variance. The PEP-S
              demonstrated very good internal reliability ($\alpha$ ranging
              from 0.88 to 0.98) and very good test-retest reliability over a
              3-week time-span (r ranging from 0.81 to 0.93). The PEP-S also
              showed excellent convergent and discriminant validity.
              Furthermore, the scale discriminated between women with high and
              low levels of eating psychopathology. The PEP-S is a
              psychometrically robust measure of pride in eating pathology. It
              has the potential to advance theoretical understanding and may
              also be clinically useful. Copyright \copyright{} 2015 John Wiley
              \& Sons, Ltd. KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGE: The PEP-S is a valid,
              reliable, quick and easy to administer self-report questionnaire
              that measures pride related to eating pathology. The PEP-S
              assesses four clinically relevant dimensions: (1) pride in weight
              loss, food control and thinness, (2) pride in healthy weight and
              healthy eating, (3) pride in outperforming others and social
              recognition and (4) pride in capturing other people's attention
              due to extreme thinness. The PEP-S has very good internal and
              test-retest reliability, and very good convergent and
              discriminant validity. The PEP-S distinguishes between women with
              higher and lower levels of eating psychopathology. The PEP-S
              makes an important contribution to understanding pride in eating
              psychopathology, which is essential from both clinical and

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: In eating disorders (EDs) treatment, outcome
              measurement has traditionally focused on symptom reduction rather
              than functioning or quality of life (QoL). Generic QoL measures
              lack sensitivity for some diagnoses and many not be responsive in
              eating disorder patients. This article describes the development
              and validation of a condition-specific QoL measure for
              adolescents and adults with eating disorders--the Eating
              Disorders Quality of Life Scale (EDQLS). METHODS: Multi-source
              and multi-stage methods were used to develop the EDQLS, with
              participation of patients with EDs, their family members and ED
              treatment providers. Sources for domain and item development
              included 39 articles, 12 patient and 10 treatment provider
              interviews, and 31 first person narratives from the internet.
              Four stages of validation and pre-testing involving 17 patients,
              10 family members and 18 providers reduced 233 items to 40 items
              in 12 domains. These items were pilot tested in 41 ED patients.
              RESULTS: The final instrument was then validated in a 12 site
              sample of 171 individuals aged 14-60 with EDs. All items showed
              good dispersion. The total raw mean score was 110 out of 200 (SD
              27.6) with higher scores indicating better QoL. Internal
              consistency was excellent (Cronbach's alpha = .96) and subscale
              internal consistency ranged from alpha .36 to .79 providing
              evidence for a strong overall construct and some
              multi-dimensionality. Validity was supported by significant
              differences in mean EDQLS according to severity levels on the
              EDI-2 (F = 95.3, p <.001) and the BSI (F = 86.9, p <.001). EDQLS
              scores were positively associated with time in treatment (F =
              4.65, p = .01) suggesting responsiveness. A strong positive
              association was also found between EDQLS scores and stage of
              change (F = 15.1 p <.001). Pearson's correlations between the
              EDQLS and criterion instrument scores were .71 for the SF-12
              mental subscale, .61 for the QoLI and .78 for the 16D, supporting
              construct validity. Exploratory principal components and item
              response theory analyses identified only a few poor fitting
              items. CONCLUSION: The EDQLS has promising psychometric

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening
              syndrome that is precipitated by the use of serotonergic drugs
              and overactivation of both the peripheral and central
              postsynaptic 5HT-1A and, most notably, 5HT-2A receptors. This
              syndrome consists of a combination of mental status changes,
              neuromuscular hyperactivity, and autonomic hyperactivity.
              Serotonin syndrome can occur via the therapeutic use of
              serotonergic drugs alone, an intentional overdose of serotonergic
              drugs, or classically, as a result of a complex drug interaction
              between two serotonergic drugs that work by different mechanisms.
              A multitude of drug combinations can result in serotonin
              syndrome. METHODS: This review describes the presentation and
              management of serotonin syndrome and discusses the drugs and
              interactions that can precipitate this syndrome with the goal of
              making physicians more alert and aware of this potentially fatal
              yet preventable syndrome. CONCLUSION: Many commonly used
              medications have proven to be the culprits of serotonin syndrome.
              Proper education and awareness about serotonin syndrome will
              improve the accuracy of diagnosis and promote the institution of

              tool exists. OBJECTIVE: To assess the validity and reliability of
              the HIS questionnaire. DESIGN: As no similar tool exists, we
              compared the HIS with three tools that reflect its key areas:
              physical impact (Pregnancy Unique Quantification of Emesis--PUQE
              score and markers of severity of HG), psychological impact
              (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score--HADS) and social impact
              (SF12 quality of life score). SETTING: A large regional referral,
              women and children's hospital in the North West of England.
              PARTICIPANTS: The HIS was evaluated on 50 women admitted to
              hospital with HG and 50 women recruited from ante-natal clinic
              without severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and with an
              uncomplicated pregnancy. RESULTS: Good criterion validity was
              demonstrated by strong significant correlations with all three

  abstract  = "This series of studies was undertaken to assess the safety
               profile of sustained-release (SR) bupropion in the treatment of
               depressed outpatients. Adults with a diagnosis of major
               depression were evaluated in 1 of 3 multicenter, randomized,
               double-masked, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trials
               conducted in private-practice psychiatric outpatient clinics.
               Following a 1-week, single-masked, placebo lead-in period,
               patients received bupropion SR for 8 weeks (study 1: 150 or 300
               mg/d; study 2: 100, 200, 300, or 400 mg/d; study 3: 50 to 150 or
               100 to 300 mg/d). Safety assessments included monitoring adverse
               events, patient discontinuation rates, changes in weight, vital
               signs, and clinical laboratory test results. Across studies, the
               most frequently reported adverse events were headache, dry
               mouth, and nausea. The incidence of adverse events was similar
               (< or =5\% difference) between the bupropion SR and placebo
               groups, with the exception of dry mouth (bupropion SR, 16\%;
               placebo, 7\%). Dry mouth, nausea, and insomnia occurred
               significantly more often in bupropion SR-treated patients than
               in patients who received placebo (P<0.05). Nearly all (94\% to
               99\%) adverse events reported in these studies were mild or
               moderate. Less than 10\% of patients in either group
               discontinued treatment prematurely because of adverse events,
               and no deaths or serious drug-related adverse events were
               reported. Sexual dysfunction was reported as an adverse event by
               <1\% of patients in either group. Bupropion SR was associated
               with dose-related weight loss in all 3 studies. No consistent
               patterns of change were observed in vital signs or in the
               results of clinical laboratory tests. Data from these 3 clinical
               trials demonstrate the favorable safety profile of bupropion SR

               occupational exposures to {HIV}",
  author    = "Lee, L M and Henderson, D K",
  abstract  = "A substantial body of evidence provides support (but not
               definitive proof of efficacy) for the use of antiretroviral
               agents as postexposure prophylaxis for occupational exposures to
               HIV in the healthcare workplace. Despite the lack of definitive
               evidence of the efficacy of these agents in this setting, over
               the past decade this intervention has become the standard of
               care for healthcare workers who sustain occupational exposures
               to HIV. Administration of these agents--even for a relatively
               short 28-day postexposure course--is often fraught with
               difficulty. All of the agents currently used for postexposure
               prophylaxis regimens have substantial adverse effects, and
               significant adverse effects occur in more than two-thirds of
               individuals electing prophylaxis. This manuscript reiterates
               current US Federal Government guidelines for the administration
               of postexposure prophylaxis, specifically noting that zidovudine
               plus lamivudine (with or without a protease inhibitor) remains
               the recommended regimen. The paper summarises the significant
               toxicities associated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase
               inhibitors (primarily nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and bone
               marrow suppression), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase
               inhibitors (rash, fever, gastrointestinal symptoms and
               hepatitis, including hepatic decompensation necessitating liver
               transplantation) and protease inhibitors (nausea, vomiting,
               diarrhoea, abdominal pain, hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia,
               headache and anorexia). As a class, the antiretroviral agents
               have an extraordinary number of drug interactions. The
               non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and the protease
               inhibitors are metabolised through the cytochrome P450 pathway,
               and the effects of concomitant administration of protease
               inhibitors with other agents in the same class are discussed, as
               well as the effects of concomitant administration of protease
               inhibitors with non-nucleoside agents. The potential for
               numerous and medically risky drug interactions emphasises the
               importance of planning antiretroviral prophylaxis in
               consultation with practitioners or clinical pharmacists who are
               skilled in the use of these agents and knowledgeable about the
               potential for significant drug interactions that could either
               reduce the benefit of prophylaxis or increase the potential for
               toxicity. Another common problem encountered by individuals
               managing postexposure prophylaxis programmes relates to the
               administration of chemoprophylaxis to a pregnant healthcare
               worker who has sustained an occupational exposure to HIV. We
               address what is known about the potential for toxicity and
               emphasise the recently published warning concerning the deaths
               of pregnant women and their offspring from lactic acidosis while

              assess the efficacy and safety of topiramate as a
              migraine-preventive therapy. DESIGN: A 26-week, randomized,
              double-blind, placebo-controlled study. SETTING: Outpatient
              treatment at 49 US clinical centers. Patients Patients were aged
              12 to 65 years, had a 6-month International Headache Society
              migraine history, and experienced 3 to 12 migraines per month,
              but had 15 or fewer headache days per month during the 28-day
              baseline period. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to
              placebo or topiramate, 50, 100, or 200 mg/d, titrated by 25 mg/wk
              to the assigned dose or as tolerated in 8 weeks; maintenance
              therapy continued for 18 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The
              primary efficacy assessment was a reduction in mean monthly
              migraine frequency across the 6-month treatment phase. Secondary
              end points were responder rate, time to onset of action, mean
              change in migraine days per month, and mean change in rescue
              medication days per month. RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-seven
              patients were randomized, and 469 composed the intent-to-treat
              population. The mean +/- SD monthly migraine frequency decreased
              significantly for the 100-mg/d group (from 5.4 +/- 2.2 to 3.3 +/-
              2.9; P <.001) and the 200-mg/d group (from 5.6 +/- 2.6 to 3.3 +/-
              2.9; P <.001) vs the placebo group (from 5.6 +/- 2.3 to 4.6 +/-
              3.0); improvements occurred within the first treatment month.
              Significantly more topiramate-treated patients (50 mg/d, 35.9\%
              [P =.04]; 100 mg/d, 54.0\% [P <.001]; and 200 mg/d, 52.3\% [P
              <.001]) exhibited a 50\% or more reduction in monthly migraine
              frequency than placebo-treated patients (22.6\%). Adverse events
              included paresthesia, fatigue, nausea, anorexia, and taste per

              capsule formulation of Adderall designed to produce a therapeutic
              effect that lasts throughout the day with 1 morning dose. The
              primary objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and
              safety of SLI381 compared with placebo in the treatment of
              attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children in a

              to assess the diurnal variation in responses based on morning and
              afternoon assessments. METHODS: A multicenter, randomized,
              double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial was
              conducted at 47 sites. After a 1-week washout of any previous
              stimulant medication, patients were randomized to receive
              single-daily morning doses of placebo or SLI381 10 mg, 20 mg, or
              30 mg for 3 weeks. Participants aged 6 to 12 years inclusive who
              satisfied Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,

              primary efficacy parameter was the Conners Global Index Scale for
              Teachers. Secondary efficacy parameters included the Conners
              Global Index Scale for Parents, the Clinical Global Impressions
              Scale for improvement, and the Parent Global Assessment for
              improvement. Safety was assessed by recording adverse events,
              laboratory tests, and vital signs at each visit during the study.
              Physical examinations and electrocardiograms were performed at
              the screening and the end of the study. RESULTS: Five hundred
              eighty-four children were randomized, 563 were included in the
              intent-to-treat population, and 509 completed the entire study.
              Intention-to-treat analysis of Conners Global Index Scale for
              Teachers and Conners Global Index Scale for Parents scores
              revealed significant improvement in morning, afternoon, and late
              afternoon behavior for all active treatment groups versus
              placebo. All active treatment groups showed significant
              dose-related improvement in behavior from baseline. Both the
              Clinical Global Impressions Scale for improvement and Parent
              Global Assessment for improvement showed all doses of SLI381 to
              be superior to placebo at treatment end and both confirmed the
              dose-response relationship between improvement and the SLI381
              dose. The incidence of spontaneously reported adverse events was
              low and similar for active treatments and placebo. CONCLUSIONS:
              SLI381 produced consistent, dose-related improvements on all
              measures of efficacy. The extended-release nature of the SLI381
              formulation was shown by continued, significant improvement in
              afternoon assessments by teachers and afternoon and late
              afternoon assessments by parents. The time course and therapeutic
              effects of SLI381 suggests that this medication is an efficacious
              once-daily treatment for children with ADHD.",

              clinical trials of fluoxetine reinforced this agent's more
              favorable adverse-event profile compared with tricyclic
              antidepressants (TCAs). OBJECTIVES: The present meta-analysis
              sought to provide a reanalysis of updated adverse-event and
              discontinuation data for fluoxetine 20 to 80 mg/d compared with
              TCAs and placebo in the treatment of major depressive disorder
              (MDD) in adults. A subanalysis to assess the safety profile of
              the most commonly used effective dose of fluoxetine in MDD (20
              mg) was also conducted. METHODS: Data were obtained from 25
              double-blind clinical trials involving 4016 patients with MDD
              randomized to treatment with fluoxetine 20 to 80 mg/d, TCAs, or
              placebo. The subanalysis included data from 6 trials involving
              1258 patients treated with fixed 20-mg doses of fluoxetine or
              placebo. Spontaneously reported treatment-emergent adverse
              events, reasons for discontinuation, and events leading to
              discontinuation were compared between groups. RESULTS: The age of
              the 4016 randomized patients ranged from 12 to 90 years, with a
              mean age of 46 years. Most patients were white (92\%), and 62\%
              were female. The age of the 1258 patients in the 20-mg fixed-dose
              population ranged from 18 to 90 years, with a mean age of 54
              years; as in the total population, most of these patients were
              white (92\%), and 57\% were female. The adverse-event profiles of
              fluoxetine and TCAs in these trials were consistent with the
              typical profiles of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and
              TCAs. At a dose of 20 mg/d, fluoxetine-treated patients had a
              discontinuation rate due to adverse events that was not
              statistically significantly different from that in placebo
              recipients. Discontinuation rates due to lack of efficacy were
              not significantly different between fluoxetine and TCAs. However,
              significantly more TCA-treated patients discontinued therapy
              because of adverse events and significantly fewer completed
              treatment compared with fluoxetine-treated patients (both, P or =
              2\%) leading to discontinuation were asthenia, dizziness,
              insomnia, nausea, nervousness, somnolence, and tremor in
              fluoxetine-treated patients and abnormal vision, agitation,
              constipation, dizziness, dry mouth, headache, nausea,
              nervousness, rash, somnolence, sweating, and tremor in
              TCA-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Data from this large series of
              clinical trials confirm that fluoxetine is well tolerated in the
              acute treatment of MDD in adults, especially at a dosage of 20
              mg/d, and is better tolerated than the recommended doses of TCAs.",

              Cosmetic Act in 1938 and escalating with the 1962 Kefauver-Harris
              amendments, increasing pressure has been placed on pharmaceutical
              manufacturers to demonstrate that a drug's benefits outweigh its
              risks. Nowhere has the question of risk versus benefit come under
              greater scrutiny than with anorectics. After the approval in the
              1940s and 1950s of a number of amphetamine and amphetamine-like
              compounds for the treatment of obesity, the U.S. Food and Drug
              Administration struggled to define the efficacy and safety of
              these agents. Labeling restrictions on duration of use and
              warnings about abuse and addiction ultimately contributed to the
              reduced use of anorectics. That trend continued until the
              mid-1990s, when the off-label use of fenfluramine plus
              phentermine (fen-phen) and the approval of dexfenfluramine gave
              rise to widespread, long-term use of anorectics to treat obesity.
              The adverse effects that came to be associated with fenfluramine
              and dexfenfluramine, leading to their eventual withdrawal from
              the market, gave pause to regulators, physicians, patients, and
              drug companies alike. Sibutramine, the latest anorectic to enter
              the market, is now the focus of a landmark trial that is

              women, aged 54 - 65 years, with increased appetite. They were
              randomly assigned in 2 groups. In group I (n = 30) fluoxetine (20
              mg in the morning) and placebo (in the evening) were administered
              for 24 weeks. Group II (n = 34) received fluoxetine (20 mg in the
              morning) and melatonin (5 mg in the evening) in the same period

              associated with enhanced neuropeptide Y (NPY) activity within the
              hypothalamus may operate in part by interacting antagonistically
              with other neural processes responsive to serotonin
              (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT). To test this possibility further,
              experiments were performed to determine if the magnitude of
              feeding produced by injecting NPY into the paraventricular
              nucleus (PVN) or the perifornical hypothalamus (PFH) was
              diminished by coinjections of 5-HT into these two sites or
              peripheral injections of the 5-HT agonist, d-fenfluramine. Adult
              male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted unilaterally with
              stainless steel cannulae aimed to terminate either in the PVN or
              the PFH. In both studies, NPY (235 pmol) produced significant
              feeding in both sites either 1 or 2 h after injection when
              compared to saline. This enhanced feeding response was
              significantly greater in the PFH 2 h after injection (40\% in the
              central study; 70\% in the peripheral study). Coinjection of 5-HT
              (6.3, 12.5, or 25.0 nmol) into either site had no effect on the
              induction of this NPY-induced feeding response. However,
              peripherally injected d-fenfluramine (0.32, 0.63, or 1.25 mg/kg)
              produced strong dose-dependent attenuation both 1- and 2-h food

              effects of systemic fenfluramine on hypothalamic NPY-induced
              feeding may operate largely via peripheral mechanisms and/or
              central ones that have little to do with its 5-HT agonistic
              effects within the PVN or PFH.",

              serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) plays an important part in
              within-meal satiation and post-meal satiety processes. Thus, the
              serotonin system has provided a viable target for weight control,
              critical to the action of at least two effective anti-obesity
              treatments, both producing clinically significant weight loss
              over a year or more. Numerous serotonin receptor subtypes have
              been identified; of these, serotonin 5-HT1B and 5-HT2C receptors
              have been specifically recognised as mediators of
              serotonin-induced satiety.A number of serotonergic drugs,
              including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs),
              dexfenfluramine and 5-HT2C receptor agonists, have been shown to
              significantly attenuate rodent bodyweight gain. This effect is
              strongly associated with marked hypophagia and is probably
              mediated by the hypothalamic melanocortin system. Additionally,
              sibutramine, dexfenfluramine, fluoxetine and the 5-HT2C receptor
              agonist chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) have all been shown to
              modify appetite in both lean and obese humans, resulting in
              reduced caloric intake. Clinical studies demonstrate serotonergic
              drugs specifically reduce appetite prior to and following the
              consumption of fixed caloric loads, and cause a reduction in
              pre-meal appetite and caloric intake at ad libitum meals. Weight
              loss in the obese has also been produced by treatment with both
              the serotonin precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan and the preferential
              5-HT2C receptor agonist mCPP.A new generation of 5-HT2C receptor
              selective agonists have been developed and at least one,
              lorcaserin (APD356), is currently undergoing clinical trials. In
              addition, 5-HT6 receptor antagonists such as PRX-07034 and
              BVT74316 have been shown to potently reduce food intake and
              bodyweight gain in rodent models and have recently entered
              clinical trials. However, the role of the 5-HT6 receptor in the
              expression of appetite remains to be determined. The hope is that
              these drugs will not only be free of their predecessors' adverse
              effect profiles, but will also be equally or more effective at
              regulating appetite and controlling bodyweight.",

              success rate for tracheal intubation in a physician-led system
              and examine the management of failed intubation and emergency
              surgical cricothyroidotomy in pre-hospital trauma patients.
              Failed intubation rates for anaesthetists and non-anaesthetists
              were compared. METHODS: A retrospective database review was
              conducted to identify trauma patients undergoing pre-hospital
              advanced airway management between September 1991 and December
              2012. The success rate of tracheal intubation and the use and
              success of rescue techniques were established. Success rates of
              tracheal intubation by individuals and by speciality were
              recorded. RESULTS: The doctor-paramedic team attended 28 939
              patients; 7256 (25.1\%) required advanced airway management. A
              surgical airway was performed immediately, without attempted
              laryngoscopy, in 46 patients (0.6\%). Tracheal intubation was
              successful in 7158 patients (99.3\%). Rescue surgical airways
              were performed in 42 patients, seven had successful insertion of
              supraglottic devices, and two patients had supraglottic device
              insertion and a surgical airway. One patient breathed
              spontaneously with bag-valve-mask support during transfer. All
              rescue techniques were successful. Non-anaesthetists performed
              4394 intubations and failed to intubate in 41 cases (0.9\%);
              anaesthetists performed 2587 intubations and failed in 11 (0.4\%)
              (P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest series of physician
              pre-hospital tracheal intubation; the success rate of 99.3\% is
              consistent with other reported data. All rescue airways were
              successful. Non-anaesthetists were twice as likely to have to
              perform a rescue airway intervention than anaesthetists. Surgical
              airway rates reported here (0.7\%) are lower than most other

              notoriously difficult. Traditional drug development fails to
              exploit knowledge of the psychological factors that crucially
              influence appetite, concentrating instead on restrictive criteria
              of intake and weight reduction, allied to a mechanistic view of
              energy regulation. Drugs are under development that may produce
              beneficial changes in appetite expression in the obese. These
              currently include glucagon-like peptide-1 analogs such as
              liraglutide, an amylin analog davalintide, the 5-HT(2C) receptor

              Intuitively, these processes should be effective targets for
              pharmacotherapy, and behavioral analysis can identify drugs that
              selectively affect desire to eat, enjoyment of eating, satiation

              as a major therapeutic advance in psychopharmacology. As a
              result, the discovery of these agents marks a milestone in
              neuropsychopharmacology and rational drug design, and has
              launched a new era in psychotropic drug development. Prior to the
              SSRIs, all psychotropic medications were the result of chance
              observation. In an attempt to develop a SSRI, researchers
              discovered a number of nontricyclic agents with amine-uptake
              inhibitory properties, acting on both noradrenergic and
              serotonergic neurons with considerable differences in potency. A
              given drug may affect one or more sites over its clinically
              relevant dosing range and may produce multiple and different
              clinical effects. The enhanced safety profile includes a reduced
              likelihood of pharmacodynamically mediated adverse drug-drug
              interactions by avoiding affects on sites that are not essential
              to the intended outcome. SSRIs were developed for inhibition of
              the neuronal uptake pump for serotonin (5-HT), a property shared
              with the TCAs, but without affecting the other various
              neuroreceptors or fast sodium channels. The therapeutic mechanism
              of action of SSRIs involves alteration in the 5-HT system. The
              plethora of biological substrates, receptors and pathways for
              5-HT are candidates to mediate not only the therapeutic actions
              of SSRIs, but also their side effects. A hypothesis to explain
              these immediate side effects is that 5-HT is increased at
              specific 5-HT receptor subtypes in discrete regions of the body
              where the relevant physiologic processes are regulated. Marked
              differences exist between the SSRIs with regard to effects on
              specific cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, and thus the likelihood
              of clinically important pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions.
              Although no clear relationship exists between the clinical
              efficacy, plasma concentration of SSRIs, nor any threshold that
              defines toxic concentrations, but therapeutic drug monitoring
              (TDM) may be useful in special populations, such as in elderly

              mephenytoin (CYP2C19), and patients with liver and kidney
              impairment. Several meta-analyses have reviewed the comparative
              efficacy of TCAs and SSRIs, and concluded that both TCAs and
              SSRIs have similar efficacy in the treatment of depression. SSRIs
              have demonstrated better efficacy and tolerability in the
              treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). They have also
              been found to be effective in the treatment for social anxiety
              disorder both in reducing total levels of social anxiety and in
              improving overall clinical condition. The benefit of SSRIs in
              anorexia nervosa (AN) is apparently short-term unless medication
              is given in the context of nutritional or behavioral therapy. No
              single antidepressant can ever be recommended for every patient,
              but in a vast majority of patients, SSRIs should be considered as
              one of the first-line drugs in the treatment of depression.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: This prospective study tested the diathesis-stress
              and causal mediation components of Beck's (1967, 1983) cognitive
              theory of depression. DESIGN: In order to allow for a stringent
              test of the aetiological component of Beck's theory, we used a
              short-term longitudinal design in which participants'
              dysfunctional attitudes were assessed prior to the occurrence of
              a negative event. METHODS: In all, 136 high school seniors
              applying to the University of Pennsylvania completed measures of
              depressed mood and dysfunctional attitudes 1-8 weeks before
              receiving their admissions decision (Time 1). The assessment of
              dysfunctional attitudes was preceded by a priming task designed
              to activate latent depressogenic schemata. Participants also
              completed measures of depressed mood, negative views of the self,
              and negative views of the future shortly after they received
              their admissions decision (Time 2) and four days later (Time 3).
              RESULTS: Consistent with the diathesis-stress component of Beck's
              theory, dysfunctional attitudes predicted increases in depressed
              mood immediately following a negative admissions outcome (Time
              2). In addition, consistent with the causal mediation component
              of the theory, in negative outcome students, the relationship
              between dysfunctional attitudes and increases in depressed mood
              was mediated by negative views of the future. Contrary to
              predictions, however, this relationship was not mediated by
              negative views of the self. In addition, contrary to predictions,
              dysfunctional attitudes did not predict enduring depressed mood
              after a negative outcome (Time 3). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with
              dysfunctional attitudes are likely to show increases in depressed
              mood following the occurrence of negative events. The
              relationship between dysfunctional attitudes and increases in
              depressed mood following the occurrence of negative events is
              mediated by negative views of the future.",

               university students enrolled in an exercise science program (n =
               118) or a business program (n = 89). The students completed the

               Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), and ORTO-15, which defines
               orthorexia nervosa as a sensitive and obsessive behavior towards
               healthy nutrition. The SF-36 showed that exercise science
               students scored worse than business students regarding bodily
               pain (72.8 vs. 82.5; p = 0.001), but better regarding general

               degree of self-reporting of pain and orthorexia nervosa in
               exercise science students may cause problems in the future,
               since they are expected to coach others in healthy living. Our

              challenging to address; however, the primary care setting
              provides an important opportunity for critical medical and
              psychosocial intervention. The recently published Diagnostic and
              Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed., includes updated
              diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa (e.g., elimination of
              amenorrhea as a diagnostic criterion) and for bulimia nervosa
              (e.g., criterion for frequency of binge episodes decreased to an
              average of once per week). In addition to the role of
              environmental triggers and societal expectations of body size and
              shape, research has suggested that genes and discrete biochemical
              signals contribute to the development of eating disorders.
              Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa occur most often in
              adolescent females and are often accompanied by depression and
              other comorbid psychiatric disorders. For low-weight patients
              with anorexia nervosa, virtually all physiologic systems are
              affected, ranging from hypotension and osteopenia to
              life-threatening arrhythmias, often requiring emergent assessment
              and hospitalization for metabolic stabilization. In patients with
              frequent purging or laxative abuse, the presence of electrolyte
              abnormalities requires prompt intervention. Family-based

              investigated the effects of fluoxetine, which inhibits serotonin
              reuptake, on food intake and the activity of the neuropeptide
              Yergic arcuato-paraventricular projection in lean Wistar and

              which obesity is postulated to be due to overactivity of the
              arcuato-paraventricular projection. Fluoxetine significantly
              reduced food intake in lean and obese rats, both during
              continuous subcutaneous infusion and (10 mg/kg/day for seven
              days) and acutely after a single injection (10 mg/kg). Fluoxetine
              also significantly reduced neuropeptide Y levels in the
              paraventricular nucleus, a major site of neuropeptide Y release
              which is highly sensitive to the appetite-stimulating actions of
              neuropeptide Y. Push-pull sampling in lean and fatty Zucker rats
              showed that neuropeptide Y secretion in the paraventricular
              nucleus was significantly reduced after acute fluoxetine
              treatment. Furthermore, seven days fluoxetine treatment prevented
              the significant increases in hypothalamic neuropeptide Y

              which precisely matched the hypophagia induced by the drug. We

              of the neuropeptide Yergic arcuato-paraventricular neurons, and
              suggest that reduced neuropeptide Y release in the
              paraventricular nucleus may mediate, at least in part, the drug's
              hypophagic action. We further suggest that serotonin may
              influence food intake and energy balance by inhibiting the
              arcuato-paraventricular projection, and that the two
              neurotransmitters may act together to regulate feeding and energy

              involvement of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and orexins in the

              assessing the effects of chronic fluoxetine treatment on NPY and
              orexin immunostaining in several hypothalamic regions. RESEARCH
              METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Male obese Zucker (fa/fa) rats were
              administered fluoxetine (10 mg/kg intraperitoneally) daily for 2
              weeks. The control group was administered 0.9\% NaCl solution.
              Carcass composition was assessed using the official methods of
              the Association of Official Analytical Chemists. To test the
              potential thermogenic effect of fluoxetine administration, total
              body oxygen consumption was measured daily for 60 minutes before
              fluoxetine or saline injection and for 30 minutes after drug or
              saline injection. Hypothalamic arcuate and paraventricular
              nuclei, and the lateral hypothalamic area were immunostained for
              NPY, orexin A, and orexin B. Commercial kits were used for serum
              determinations. RESULTS: Chronic fluoxetine administration in
              obese Zucker rats generated a reduction in body weight gain, food
              intake, adipocyte size, fat mass, and body protein. A decrease in
              NPY immunostaining in the paraventricular nucleus, without
              changes in the arcuate, was observed. However, no changes were
              observed in the number of neural cells immunostained for orexin A
              or orexin B in the lateral hypothalamic area. DISCUSSION: Due to
              the hyperphagic effect of NPY in the paraventricular nucleus,
              these results suggest that NPY, but not orexins, could be
              involved in the anorexigenic effect of fluoxetine in obese Zucker

              consumption was examined by providing subjects diets that
              engendered varied levels of carbohydrate intake. When subjects
              received placebo and had access to a regular diet, they consumed
              3400 kcal day-1 (53\% carbohydrate, 34\% fat, 13\% protein); and
              fluoxetine decreased caloric intake to 2770 Kcal, without

              subjects received fluoxetine was not different from intake under

              weight-concerns, each of them combined with elite athlete, young
              elite athlete, adolescent elite athlete and elite sports.
              Overall, data are inconsistent. In general, athletes do not seem
              to be at a higher risk for pathogenic weight concerns and
              weight-control behaviour. It does seem to be more prevalent in
              leanness sports, though. There is evidence for pathogenic
              weight-control behaviour in both genders; male athletes mostly
              trying to gain weight whereas females emphasise weight reduction.
              There is not enough data to make predictions about connections
              with age of onset. Young elite athletes do show weight-control
              behaviour with varying degrees of frequency and severity. In
              particular, leanness sports seem to be a risk factor for weight
              manipulation. Further research is needed for more details and
              possible connections.",

              Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).
              METHOD: Six hundred sixty-eight patients recruited for the
              Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study (CLPS)
              were reliably assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for
              DSM-IV Axis I Disorders and the Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV
              Personality Disorders. The distribution of ED diagnoses was

               adults and has previously been shown to have negative effects on
               body image, depression, social comparison, and disordered
               eating. One eating disorder of interest in this context is
               orthorexia nervosa, an obsession with eating healthily. High
               orthorexia nervosa prevalence has been found in populations who
               take an active interest in their health and body and is
               frequently comorbid with anorexia nervosa. Here, we investigate
               links between social media use, in particularly Instagram and
               orthorexia nervosa symptoms. METHODS: We conducted an online
               survey of social media users (N = 680) following health food
               accounts. We assessed their social media use, eating behaviours,
               and orthorexia nervosa symptoms using the ORTO-15 inventory.
               RESULTS: Higher Instagram use was associated with a greater
               tendency towards orthorexia nervosa, with no other social media
               channel having this effect. In exploratory analyses Twitter
               showed a small positive association with orthorexia symptoms.
               BMI and age had no association with orthorexia nervosa. The
               prevalence of orthorexia nervosa among the study population was
               49\%, which is significantly higher than the general population
               (<1\%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the healthy eating
               community on Instagram has a high prevalence of orthorexia
               symptoms, with higher Instagram use being linked to increased
               symptoms. These findings highlight the implications social media
               can have on psychological wellbeing, and the influence social
               media 'celebrities' may have over hundreds of thousands of
               individuals. These results may also have clinical implications
               for eating disorder development and recovery.",

  abstract  = "Background: Orthorexia nervosa is the pathological obsession for
               consuming only biologically pure food that may lead to the
               development of specific ritualistic attitudes towards food
               preparation and the restriction of specific food groups that can
               be harmful to one's health (Zamora et al., 2005; Matera, 2012).
               Aim: Due to the rise in popularity with Instagram and online
               eating disorder communities, and the potential negative outcomes
               on psychosocial health, the purpose of this descriptive study
               was to investigate images tagged with \#orthorexia on Instagram
               over 7 days. Methods: A mixed methods approach was utilized for
               this study. A text analysis was conducted using the Netlytic
               program (Gruzd, 2016) to explore for emerging themes of
               discussion specifically using word count frequency, and a
               network analysis using both a name network (i.e., who mentions
               whom) and a chain network (i.e., who replies to whom) was
               performed. Among a subsample of images, author/image information
               was manually obtained, and a coding scheme (adapted from
               Tiggemann and Zaccardo, 2016) was implemented for a subsample of
               images (results pending). Results: Among the 4,533 records
               downloaded, there were 48,780 unique words associated with the
               posts (in the description of the picture or in the comment
               section). Majority of most commonly used words were associated
               with eating disorder recovery (i.e., 425 instances of
               \#edrecovery; 340 instances of \#recovery; 297 instances of
               \#eatingdisorderrecovery). The chain network/direct interactions
               analysis indicated a large online presence with 1,503 nodes
               (i.e., users) and 1,803 ties (i.e., direct replies between
               users). The coding of \#orthorexia images is pending but will
               help us further understand the orthorexia online community.
               Conclusions: As the network analysis and text analysis suggested
               an eating disorder recovery theme, this suggests that Instagram
               may be being used as a supportive and interactive community for
               those who have/had symptoms of orthorexia.",

              Our paper notes the important contribution of school educators
              whilst warning of the current need to specifically examine how
              teachers and school personnel may be best trained and prepared
              for such a preventive role, whether they currently feel willing

              teachers may be personally susceptible to body image and eating
              problems. It is vital to understand the knowledge, behaviors,
              attitudes, and expectations of educators implementing prevention
              programs in order to ensure that they are personally and

              understanding whether they are in a good position to support

               social messages about the body, health, and self. Research has
               suggested that both the formal and informal contexts of

               places moral obligation and blame on individuals for their
               health/problem. In this paper we explore the ways in which young
               women with eating disorders constructed their identities within
               and against the various ?health? discourses now found within
               schools. Data is presented from life history interviews with

               eating disorders in the UK. The experiences of the young women
               in the study point towards the ways in which schools, despite

              associated with adverse health consequences, including increased
              risk for body dissatisfaction and disordered eating behaviors,
              which are risk factors for eating disorders. Although concerns
              about these problems have stimulated calls for broader
              intervention efforts in schools, actions thus far have been
              limited. This study examined educators' perspectives about
              potential policy actions to address these issues in schools.
              METHODS: Educators (N = 240) completed an online questionnaire
              assessing their support for 11 potential school-based policy
              actions to address weight-related bullying and eating disorders.
              Participants also rated policies according to their feasibility
              and potential for positive impact. RESULTS: Forty-eight percent
              of participants observed weight-related bullying in their school
              and 99\% expressed the importance of intervening in such
              incidents. A large majority (75\%-94\%) supported 8 of the 11
              policies, especially actions requiring school-based health
              curriculum to include content on eating disorder prevention
              (94\%), and addressing weight-bullying through antibullying
              policies (92\%), staff training (89\%), and school curriculum

              as being the most impactful and feasible to implement.

              Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ). Individuals score in the range
              0-50. Four groups of subjects were assessed: Group 1: 58 adults

              Group 2: 174 randomly selected controls. Group 3: 840 students in
              Cambridge University; and Group 4: 16 winners of the UK
              Mathematics Olympiad. The adults with AS/HFA had a mean AQ score
              of 35.8 (SD = 6.5), significantly higher than Group 2 controls (M
              = 16.4, SD = 6.3). 80\% of the adults with AS/HFA scored 32+,
              versus 2\% of controls. Among the controls, men scored slightly
              but significantly higher than women. No women scored extremely
              highly (AQ score 34+) whereas 4\% of men did so. Twice as many
              men (40\%) as women (21\%) scored at intermediate levels (AQ
              score 20+). Among the AS/HFA group, male and female scores did
              not differ significantly. The students in Cambridge University
              did not differ from the randomly selected control group, but
              scientists (including mathematicians) scored significantly higher
              than both humanities and social sciences students, confirming an
              earlier study that autistic conditions are associated with
              scientific skills. Within the sciences, mathematicians scored
              highest. This was replicated in Group 4, the Mathematics Olympiad
              winners scoring significantly higher than the male Cambridge
              humanities students. 6\% of the student sample scored 32+ on the
              AQ. On interview, 11 out of 11 of these met three or more DSM-IV
              criteria for AS/HFA, and all were studying sciences/mathematics,
              and 7 of the 11 met threshold on these criteria. Test-retest and
              interrater reliability of the AQ was good. The AQ is thus a

              individual is situated on the continuum from autism to normality.

              clinical features between some children with High Intellectual
              Potential (HIP or ``Giftedness'' = Total IQ > 2 SD), and children
              with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) without intellectual or
              language delay, formerly diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome. Some
              of these common features are social interaction impairments,
              special interests, and in some cases high-verbal abilities. The
              aim of this article is to determine whether these similarities
              exist at more fundamental levels, other than clinical, and to
              explore the literature in order to provide empirical support for
              an overlap between ASD and HIP. Method: First, comparative
              studies between ASD and HIP children were sought. Because of a
              lack of data, the respective characteristics of ASD and HIP
              subjects were explored by a cross-sectional review of different
              areas of research. Emphasis was placed on psychometric and
              cognitive evaluations, experimental and developmental
              assessments, and neurobiological research, following a
              ``bottom-up'' procedure. Results: This review highlights the
              existence of similarities in the neurocognitive, developmental
              and neurobiological domains between these profiles, which require
              further study. In addition, the conclusions of several studies
              show that there are differences between HIP children with a
              homogeneous Intellectual Quotient profile and children with a
              heterogeneous Intellectual Quotient profile. Conclusion: HIP
              seems to cover different developmental profiles, one of which
              might share features with ASD. A new line of investigation
              providing a possible starting-point for future research is

              aspects of the environment is now included in the DSM-5

              processing differences who do not meet an ASD diagnosis but do
              show atypical sensory behaviors to the same or greater degree as
              ASD children. We previously demonstrated that children with
              Sensory Processing Disorders (SPD) have impaired white matter
              microstructure, and that this white matter microstructural
              pathology correlates with atypical sensory behavior. In this
              study, we use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) fiber tractography
              to evaluate the structural connectivity of specific white matter
              tracts in boys with ASD (n = 15) and boys with SPD (n = 16),
              relative to typically developing children (n = 23). We define
              white matter tracts using probabilistic streamline tractography
              and assess the strength of tract connectivity using mean
              fractional anisotropy. Both the SPD and ASD cohorts demonstrate
              decreased connectivity relative to controls in parieto-occipital
              tracts involved in sensory perception and multisensory
              integration. However, the ASD group alone shows impaired
              connectivity, relative to controls, in temporal tracts thought to
              subserve social-emotional processing. In addition to these group
              difference analyses, we take a dimensional approach to assessing
              the relationship between white matter connectivity and
              participant function. These correlational analyses reveal
              significant associations of white matter connectivity with
              auditory processing, working memory, social skills, and
              inattention across our three study groups. These findings help
              elucidate the roles of specific neural circuits in
              neurodevelopmental disorders, and begin to explore the

               Autism affects more male than female individuals, and

               dysfunction, and atypical perceptual and information processing.
               These profiles are underpinned by atypical neural development at

  abstract  = "ABSTRACTAn increased interest in health, diet, and physical
               activity exist among young people, in this study termed ?fitness
               hype?. Viewing the body and health as commodities can be
               understood as part of a healthism discourse. In this study, we
               explored how Swedish high school students perceive and negotiate
               the trend regarding exercise, diet and body ideals.
               Semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten high school
               students, aged 16?18 years, from various educational programs
               and with varying levels of physical activity. Using qualitative
               content analysis, we developd one overarching theme navigating
               life satisfaction in the face of an ?unhealthy fitness hype?.
               Four additional, interrelated categories showed how the young
               people negotiated this developing trend through: (1) the quest
               for social recognition and value, (2) social media sets the
               standards, (3) the paradox of strong and skinny as the new
               standard, and (4) the need for new safety nets. Our results
               highlight the young people?s perceptions of an excessive and
               influential focus on health and exercise in contemporary
               society. They described a fitness hype as exorbitant and
               unhealthy ideals of body and exercise, and understood this as
               problematic. Social media was seen as contributing to this hype
               as a powerful arena for ?the quest for social recognition and
               value?. While not all the young people felt negatively affected
               by the fitness hype, they perceived its influence on their
               lives. Further, body and fitness ideals were gendered. Teenage
               girls faced the paradox of shaping themselves as ?strong and
               skinny?. Social ties were recognized as an important safety net,
               particularly classmates, sports mates, and coaches. Knowledge of
               these problems from the perspective of young people is crucially
               needed among health professionals and educators. Further
               research should explore additional support strategies, and young
               people?s experiences of fitness hype among additional youth

              popular health-promoting places, but exercise-related problems,
              disordered eating and ON-like behaviour are increasing. Personal
              trainers (PTs) play an important role in detecting unhealthy

              understandings of healthy and unhealthy exercise and eating
              behaviours in relation to orthorexia nervosa in a fitness gym
              context. Five focus groups with 14 PTs were conducted. These were
              analysed using interpretative qualitative content analysis and
              Becker's model ``Kinds of Deviance.'' In contrast to PTs' health
              norms (practicing balanced behaviours and contributing to
              well-being), ON was expressed mainly in terms of exercise
              behaviour and as being excessive and in total control. The PTs
              maintain that extreme behaviours are legitimized by an aggressive
              exercise trend in society and that they fear to falsely accuse

              requirements for the Business Support System (BSS) in
              telecommunications networks. It is crucial and essential for
              service providers to maintain good operating state of the BSS. In
              this paper, we aim at system error prediction for a BSS, i.e., we
              predict occurrences of the abnormal state or behavior of the BSS.
              Because the occurrences of system errors are rare events in the
              BSS (i.e., the dataset of system status is highly imbalanced), it
              is highly challenging to use machine learning or deep learning
              algorithms to predict system error for the BSS. To address this
              challenge, we propose a machine learning based framework for the
              system error prediction and a Frequency-based Feature Creation
              (FFC) algorithm to create new features to improve prediction. By
              adding the time-series information created by the existing
              features, the proposed FFC can amplify the effects of important
              features. Our experimental results show that the FFC

              dynamics of its causative agent-severe acute respiratory syndrome

              non-pharmaceutical interventions have suppressed the local

              reconstruct the full-spectrum dynamics of COVID-19 in Wuhan
              between 1 January and 8 March 2020 across 5 periods defined by
              events and interventions, on the basis of 32,583
              laboratory-confirmed cases1. Accounting for presymptomatic
              infectiousness2, time-varying ascertainment rates, transmission
              rates and population movements3, we identify two key features of
              the outbreak: high covertness and high transmissibility. We
              estimate 87\% (lower bound, 53\%) of the infections before 8
              March 2020 were unascertained (potentially including asymptomatic
              and mildly symptomatic individuals); and a basic reproduction
              number (R0) of 3.54 (95\% credible interval 3.40-3.67) in the
              early outbreak, much higher than that of severe acute respiratory
              syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)4,5.
              We observe that multipronged interventions had considerable
              positive effects on controlling the outbreak, decreasing the
              reproduction number to 0.28 (95\% credible interval 0.23-0.33)
              and-by projection-reducing the total infections in Wuhan by
              96.0\% as of 8 March 2020. We also explore the probability of
              resurgence following the lifting of all interventions after 14
              consecutive days of no ascertained infections; we estimate this
              probability at 0.32 and 0.06 on the basis of models with 87\% and
              53\% unascertained cases, respectively-highlighting the risk
              posed by substantial covert infections under changing control
              measures. These results have important implications when
              considering strategies of continuing surveillance and

  abstract  = "RNA has a dual role as an informational molecule and a direct
               effector of biological tasks. The latter function is enabled by
               RNA's ability to adopt complex secondary and tertiary folds and
               thus has motivated extensive computational and experimental
               efforts for determining RNA structures. Existing approaches for
               evaluating RNA structure have been largely limited to in vitro
               systems, yet the thermodynamic forces which drive RNA folding in
               vitro may not be sufficient to predict stable RNA structures in
               vivo. Indeed, the presence of RNA-binding proteins and
               ATP-dependent helicases can influence which structures are
               present inside cells. Here we present an approach for globally
               monitoring RNA structure in native conditions in vivo with
               single-nucleotide precision. This method is based on in vivo
               modification with dimethyl sulphate (DMS), which reacts with
               unpaired adenine and cytosine residues, followed by deep
               sequencing to monitor modifications. Our data from yeast and
               mammalian cells are in excellent agreement with known messenger
               RNA structures and with the high-resolution crystal structure of
               the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosome. Comparison between in
               vivo and in vitro data reveals that in rapidly dividing cells
               there are vastly fewer structured mRNA regions in vivo than in
               vitro. Even thermostable RNA structures are often denatured in
               cells, highlighting the importance of cellular processes in
               regulating RNA structure. Indeed, analysis of mRNA structure
               under ATP-depleted conditions in yeast shows that
               energy-dependent processes strongly contribute to the
               predominantly unfolded state of mRNAs inside cells. Our studies
               broadly enable the functional analysis of physiological RNA
               structures and reveal that, in contrast to the Anfinsen view of
               protein folding whereby the structure formed is the most
               thermodynamically favourable, thermodynamics have an incomplete
               role in determining mRNA structure in vivo.",

              carcinoma. However, the role of KIT expression and mutations in
              carcinoma showing thymus-like elements is not fully understood.
              In the current study, 8 cases of carcinoma showing thymus-like
              elements were reported, and immunohistochemical staining with KIT
              and CD5 was performed. Mutation analyses in the juxtamembrane
              domains (exons 9 and 11) and in the tyrosine kinase domains
              (exons 13 and 17) were performed on KIT-positive samples using
              polymerase chain reaction and direct DNA sequencing. KIT- and
              CD5-positive stainings were observed in all 8 cases. However,
              none of the tested samples showed mutations in any of the 4
              exons. The primary carcinoma showing thymus-like elements of the
              thyroid frequently expresses KIT and CD5 proteins; similar to
              thymic squamous cell carcinoma, the overexpression of KIT does
              not necessarily indicate a gene mutation in this tumor. KIT,
              along with CD5, could be a useful marker for the difficult
              diagnosis of carcinoma showing thymus-like elements, which should
              be added to the list of KIT-positive neoplasms.",

              connected layers in SNNs using a spike-timing-dependent
              plasticity (STDP) rule. In our approach, sub-networks compete via
              inhibitory interactions to learn features from different
              locations of the input space. These locally-connected SNNs
              (LC-SNNs) manifest key topological features of the spatial
              interaction of biological neurons. We explore a biologically
              inspired n-gram classification approach allowing parallel
              processing over various patches of the image space. We report the
              classification accuracy of simple two-layer LC-SNNs on two image
              datasets, which respectively match state-of-art performance and
              are the first results to date. LC-SNNs have the advantage of fast

              learnable parameters than other SNN approaches with unsupervised
              learning. Robustness tests demonstrate that LC-SNNs exhibit

              barriers to clinical and academic productivity, research success,
              and work-life balance. We sought to determine if the Eastern
              Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) Mentoring Program
              has met its goals of fostering academic and personal growth in
              young acute care surgeons. METHODS: We conducted a systematic
              program evaluation of EAST Mentoring Program's first 4 years.
              Demographic information was collected from EAST records,
              mentorship program applications, and mentee-mentor career
              development plans. We reviewed the career development plans for
              thematic commonalities and results of a structured, online
              questionnaire distributed since program inception. A mixed
              methods approach was used to better understand the program goals
              from both mentee and mentor perspectives, as well as attitudes
              and barriers regarding the perceived success of this career
              development program. RESULTS: During 2012 to 2015, 65 mentoring
              dyads were paired and 60 completed the program. Of 184 surveys
              distributed, 108 were returned (57\% response rate). Respondents
              were evenly distributed between mentees and mentors (53 vs. 55, p
              = 0.768). In participant surveys, mentoring relationships were
              viewed to focus on research (45\%), ``sticky situations'' (e.g.,
              communication, work-life balance) (27\%), education (18\%), or
              administrative issues (10\%). Mentees were more focused on
              research and education versus mentors (74\% vs. 50\%; p = 0.040).
              Mentees felt that goals were ``always'' or ``usually'' met versus
              mentors (89\% vs. 77\%; p = 0.096). Two barriers to successful
              mentorship included time and communication, with most pairs
              communicating by email. Most respondents (91\%) planned to
              continue the relationship beyond the EAST Mentoring Program and
              recommended the experience to colleagues. CONCLUSION: Mentee
              satisfaction with the EAST Mentoring Program was high. Mentoring
              is a beneficial tool to promote success among EAST's young
              members, but differences exist between mentee and mentor
              perceptions. Revising communication expectations and time

              In two studies, we examined the social stigma of clean dieting
              and orthorexia. METHOD: In Study 1, participants read a vignette
              describing a woman following a ``clean'' diet, a woman with
              anorexia, or a control target (minimal information about the
              individual). In Study 2, participants read a vignette describing
              a woman with orthorexia, a woman displaying identical orthorexic
              behaviors but without the orthorexia label, a woman with
              anorexia, or a control target. Participants then rated the target
              individual on a range of measures assessing stereotypes,
              emotions, and behavioral intentions toward the target. RESULTS:
              Study 1 found that the clean-dieting target was evaluated more
              negatively than the control target on some dimensions, but less
              negatively than the target with anorexia nervosa. Study 2 found
              that evaluations of the targets with orthorexia nervosa were more
              negative than evaluations of a control target, but did not differ
              from evaluations of the target with anorexia nervosa. Perceptions
              of the target's control over her behavior were associated with
              more positive evaluations (Studies 1 and 2), whereas perceptions
              of blame and responsibility for the condition were associated
              with more negative evaluations (Study 2). CONCLUSIONS: Overall,

  abstract = "The Behavioral Satiety Sequence (BSS) is the name given to the
              orderly transitions of eating, activity grooming and resting
              measured during the postingestive period. Because the BSS is
              considered to reflect the operations of natural physiological
              processes underlying satiety, the sequence can be used to
              discriminate between different drugs (and other manipulations)
              that reduce food intake via these natural physiological
              mechanisms or those that do so by interference. The BSS is only
              produced by the presence of a caloric load in the gut, and the
              preabsorptive satiety factors (such as CCK) the caloric load
              triggers. The BSS is most accurately defined by continuous
              observation rather than time or event sampling techniques
              [Partial Time Sampling (PTS) or Momentary Time Sampling (MTS)].
              Continuous observation also allows the true duration and true
              frequency of each behavior to be analyzed. Continuous observation
              can be used to determine if the profiles associated with the
              reduction in food intake is caused by nausea, sedation,
              hyperactivity, or altered palatability of food. At the present
              time is it possible to identify a number of drugs whose
              suppression of food intake is associated with the disruption or
              preservation of the BSS. Drugs that increase synaptic 5-HT
              activity such d-fenfluramine, fluoxetine. and sibutramine all
              preserve the BSS and advance the onset of resting. The 5-HT1b/2c
              agonists mCPP and TFMPP and the 5-HT1b agonist CP-94,253 produce
              similar effects. However, the 5-HT2 agonist DOI and the 5-HT1a/1b
              agonist RU-24969 disrupt the BSS by inducing hyperactivity as
              does amphetamine. The 5-HT2 agonist MK-212 disrupts the BSS by
              inducing sedation. Selective dopamine agonists, at low doses,
              such as SKF-38393 (DA1) and LY-171555 (DA2) also preserve the
              BSS. However, detailed behavioral analysis of the effects of many

  author    = "Scrinis, Gyorgy",
  abstract  = "Popularized by Michael Pollan in his best-selling In Defense of
               Food, Gyorgy Scrinis's concept of nutritionism refers to the
               reductive understanding of nutrients as the key indicators of
               healthy food -- an approach that has dominated nutrition
               science, dietary advice, and food marketing. Scrinis argues this
               ideology has narrowed and in some cases distorted our
               appreciation of food quality, such that even highly processed
               foods may be perceived as healthful depending on their content
               of ``good'' or ``bad'' nutrients. Investigating the butter
               versus margarine debate, the battle between low-fat, low-carb,
               and other weight-loss diets, and the food industry's strategic
               promotion of nutritionally enhanced foods, Scrinis reveals the
               scientific, social, and economic factors driving our modern
               fascination with nutrition.Scrinis develops an original
               framework and terminology for analyzing the characteristics and
               consequences of nutritionism since the late nineteenth century.
               He begins with the era of quantification, in which the idea of
               protective nutrients, caloric reductionism, and vitamins'
               curative effects took shape. He follows with the era of good and
               bad nutritionism, which set nutricentric dietary guidelines and
               defined the parameters of unhealthy nutrients; and concludes
               with our current era of functional nutritionism, in which the
               focus has shifted to targeted nutrients, superfoods, and optimal
               diets. Scrinis's research underscores the critical role of
               nutrition science and dietary advice in shaping our relationship
               to food and our bodies and in heightening our nutritional
               anxieties. He ultimately shows how nutritionism has aligned the
               demands and perceived needs of consumers with the commercial
               interests of food manufacturers and corporations. Scrinis also
               offers an alternative paradigm for assessing the healthfulness
               of foods -- the food quality paradigm -- that privileges food
               production and processing quality, cultural-traditional
               knowledge, and sensual-practical experience, and promotes less
               reductive forms of nutrition research and dietary advice.",

              challenging to address; however, the primary care setting
              provides an important opportunity for critical medical and
              psychosocial intervention. The recently published Diagnostic and
              Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed., includes updated
              diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa (e.g., elimination of
              amenorrhea as a diagnostic criterion) and for bulimia nervosa
              (e.g., criterion for frequency of binge episodes decreased to an
              average of once per week). In addition to the role of
              environmental triggers and societal expectations of body size and
              shape, research has suggested that genes and discrete biochemical
              signals contribute to the development of eating disorders.
              Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa occur most often in
              adolescent females and are often accompanied by depression and
              other comorbid psychiatric disorders. For low-weight patients
              with anorexia nervosa, virtually all physiologic systems are
              affected, ranging from hypotension and osteopenia to
              life-threatening arrhythmias, often requiring emergent assessment
              and hospitalization for metabolic stabilization. In patients with
              frequent purging or laxative abuse, the presence of electrolyte
              abnormalities requires prompt intervention. Family-based
              treatment is helpful for adolescents with anorexia nervosa,

              medications for patients with bulimia nervosa. Treatment is most

  abstract = "Adult, regularly cycling female Fischer rats were injected daily
              with 10 mg/kg fluoxetine for 12-23 days. In the first experiment,
              body weight and vaginal smears were monitored daily. Fluoxetine
              treatment reduced body weight within the first 24 h of treatment.
              Fluoxetine treatment also elongated the estrous cycle, reduced
              blood levels of progesterone, and eliminated lordosis behavior.
              In the second experiment, body weight and food intake were
              examined and a pair-fed group was included to determine if
              fluoxetine-induced anorexia contributed to the disturbance of the
              estrous cycle. In pair-fed rats, effects similar to fluoxetine
              treatment were present. These results lead to the suggestion that
              fluoxetine's anorectic properties could disrupt the female's
              normal endocrine cyclicity and that this disruption could be
              relevant to the reduction in sexual behavior and motivation.
              However, when the duration of fluoxetine treatment was extended
              beyond 16 to 17 days, fluoxetine-treated female rats reinitiated
              vaginal cyclicity and showed evidence of normal sexual
              receptivity. In contrast, the estrous cycles of their pair-fed
              counterparts remained disrupted. Thus, restricted food intake
              appears to contribute to the disruption of the estrous cycle and
              elimination of sexual receptivity during fluoxetine treatment.
              However, compensatory changes in the serotonergic system that are
              associated with chronic fluoxetine administration may contribute
              to the gradual recovery of estrous cyclicity and sexual
              receptivity of the fluoxetine-treated animals.",

              considered separately, it was determined that there is no
              significant difference between men and women, which confirms the
              results of the t-test. The effect of age on the three dimensions

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: In eating disorders (EDs), treatment outcome
              measurement has traditionally focused on symptom reduction rather
              than functioning or quality of life (QoL). The Eating Disorders
              Quality of Life Scale (EDQLS) was recently developed to allow for
              measurement of broader outcomes. We examined responsiveness of
              the EDQLS in a longitudinal multi-site study. METHODS: The EDQLS
              and comparator generic QoL scales were collected in person at
              baseline, and 3 and 6 months from 130 participants (mean age 25.6
              years; range 14-60) in 12 treatment programs in four Canadian
              provinces. Total score differences across the time points and
              responsiveness were examined using both anchor- and
              distribution-based methods. RESULTS: 98 (75\%) and 85 (65\%)
              responses were received at 3 and 6 months respectively. No
              statistically significant differences were found between the
              baseline sample and those lost to follow-up on any measured
              characteristic. Mean EDQLS total scores increased from 110 (SD =
              24) to 124.5 (SD = 29) at 3 months and 129 (SD = 28) at 6 months,
              and the difference by time was tested using a general linear
              model (GLM) to account for repeated measurement (p < .001).
              Responsiveness was good overall (Cohen's d = .61 and .80), and
              confirmed using anchor methods across 5 levels of self-reported
              improvement in health status (p < .001). Effect sizes across time
              were moderate or large for for all age groups. Internal
              consistency (Chronbach's alpha=.96) held across measurement
              points and patterns of responsiveness held across subscales.
              EDQLS responsiveness exceeded that of the Quality of Life
              Inventory, the Short Form-12 (mental and physical subscales) and
              was similar to the 16-dimension quality of life scale.
              CONCLUSIONS: The EDQLS is responsive to change in geographically
              diverse and clinically heterogeneous programs over a relatively
              short time period in adolescents and adults. It shows promise as
              an outcome measure for both research and clinical practice.",

              impact: accommodation and burden. The current study describes the
              scale's development and preliminary validation. Methods One
              hundred thirty-four adults, identifying as the relative of
              someone with problematic hoarding (n=102) or normative collecting
              behavior (n=32), completed the FISH alongside measures of
              hoarding severity, burden, functional impairment, and quality of
              life (QoL). Exploratory factor analysis (FA) was used to examine
              the scale's factor structure. Internal consistency, known-groups
              and convergent validity were also investigated. Results FA
              supported two factors, accounting for 65.43\% of variance. Of the
              scale items, 16 were determined to load onto these factors. Items
              that did not load were omitted. The revised scale accounted for
              67.41\% of variance and was characterized by good internal

              Combining contemporary psychodynamic, Jungian and gender identity
              theory, this approach reflects the unique path of transgender
              identity development. Transgender identity is not viewed as
              inherently pathological. Rather, the issues that emerge in
              psychotherapy with transgender clients, like with all people, are
              about the self and self-in-relation, negotiating identity with
              outer reality. For the transgender person, however, psychological
              issues are particularly related to faulty mirroring during
              periods of identity construction because the transgender self is

              development involves a body/mind mismatch and is affected by

              Furthermore, three out of ten stated that they had tried diets to

              food and dietary products that help you realize the dream of a

              gained wide acceptance over the past few years is that they are
              in conflict with the national guidelines for a healthy diet.

               nervosa--an obsession with eating healthfully--and offer expert
               advice on how to treat it. As Americans become better informed
               about health, more and more people have turned to diet as a way
               to lose weight and keep themselves in peak condition. Anorexia
               nervosa and bulimia nervosa--disorders in which the sufferer
               focuses on the quantity of food eaten--have been highly
               documented over the past decade. But as Dr. Steven Bratman
               asserts in this breakthrough book, for many people, eating
               ``correctly'' has become an equally harmful obsession, one that
               causes them to adopt progressively more rigid diets that not
               only eliminate crucial nutrients and food groups, but ultimately
               cost them their overall health, personal relationships, and
               emotional well-being. Health Food Junkies is the first book to
               identify this new eating disorder, orthorexia nervosa, and to
               offer detailed, practical advice on how to cope with and
               overcome it. Orthorexia nervosa occurs when the victim becomes
               obsessed, not with the quantity of food eaten, but the quality
               of the food. What starts as a devotion to healthy eating can
               evolve into a pattern of incredibly strict diets; victims become
               so focused on eating a ``pure'' diet (usually raw vegetables and
               grains) that the planning and preparation of food come to play
               the dominant role in their lives. Health Food Junkies provides
               an expert analysis of some of today's most popular diets--from
               The Zone to macrobiotics, raw-foodism to food allergy
               elimination--and shows not only how they can lead to orthorexia,
               but how they are often built on faulty logic rather than sound
               medical advice. Offering expert insight gleaned from his work
               with orthorexia patients, Dr. Bratman outlines the symptoms of
               orthorexia, describes its progression, and shows readers how to
               diagnose the condition. Finally, Dr. Bratman offers practical
               suggestions for intervention and treatment, giving readers the
               tools they need to conquer this painful disorder, rediscover the
               joys of eating, and reclaim their lives. From the Hardcover

              2:1; the figure was sensibly lower with the 35-point threshold

              Professional identity is defined here as a sense of connection to
              the values and emphases of counselling psychology. The retention
              of professional identity seems important for counselling
              psychologists in health care settings. This is considering that
              the application of counselling psychology principles has the
              potential to make their contributions unique among mental health
              professionals in the health care arena. Here, the authors
              describe the evolution of `counselling health psychology' and
              address issues of professional identity. Limitations of existing
              literature are examined. Recommendations for future research are
              also made.",

              related to orthorexia nervosa. The purpose of the present study
              was to validate the Polish version of the ORTHO-15 test. METHODS:
              341 women and 59 men (N = 400) were recruited, whose age ranged
              from 18 to 35 years. Mean age was 23.09 years (SD = 3.14) in
              women and 24.02 years (SD = 3.87) in men. The ORTHO-15 test and
              the EAT-26 test were used in the present study. RESULTS: Factor
              analysis (exploratory and confirmatory analysis) was used in the
              present study. Exploratory factor analysis performed on the
              initial 15 items from a random split half of the study group
              suggested a nine-item two-factor structure. Confirmatory factor
              analysis performed on the second randomly selected half of the
              study group supported this two-factor structure of the ORTHO-15
              test. The Polish version of the ORTHO-15 test demonstrated an
              internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) equal to 0.644.
              CONCLUSION: The Polish version of the ORTHO-15 test is a reliable
              and valuable instrument to assess obsessive attitudes related to
              healthy and proper nutrition in Polish female and male

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Adolescence and young adulthood are key periods for
               developing norms related to health behaviors and body image, and
               social media can influence these norms. Social media is
               saturated with content related to dieting, fitness, and health.
               Health and fitness-related social media content has received
               significant media attention for often containing objectifying
               and inaccurate health messages. Limited research has identified
               problematic features of such content, including stigmatizing
               language around weight, portraying guilt-related messages
               regarding food, and praising thinness. However, no research has
               identified who is ``liking'' or ``following'' (ie, consuming)
               such content. OBJECTIVE: This exploratory study aimed to
               identify demographics, mental health, and substance use-related
               behaviors that predicted consuming 3 types of health and
               fitness-related social media content-weight loss/fitness
               motivation pages (ie, ``fitspiration''), detox/cleanse pages,
               and diet/fitness plan pages-among young social media users.
               METHODS: Participants (N=1001; age: median 21.06, IQR
               17.64-24.64; female: 723/1001, 72.23\%) completed a
               cross-sectional 112-question online survey aimed at social media
               users aged between 15-29 years residing in Victoria, Australia.
               Logistic regression was used to determine which characteristics
               predicted consuming the 3 types of health and fitness-related
               social media content. RESULTS: A total of 378 (37.76\%)
               participants reported consuming at least 1 of the 3 types of
               health and fitness-related social media content: 308 (30.77\%)
               fitspiration pages, 145 (14.49\%) detox pages, and 235 (23.48\%)
               diet/fitness plan pages. Of the health and fitness-related
               social media content consumers, 85.7\% (324/378) identified as
               female and 44.8\% (324/723) of all female participants consumed
               at least 1 type of health and fitness-related social media
               content. Predictors of consuming at least one type of health and
               fitness-related social media content in univariable analysis
               included female gender (OR 3.5, 95\% CI 2.5-4.9, P<.001), being
               aged 15-17 years (OR 3.0, 95\% CI 2.2-4.0, P<.001), residing
               outside a major city (OR 2.0, 95\% CI 1.4-2.9, P<.001), having
               no post-high school education (OR 2.2, 95\% CI 1.7-2.9, P<.001),
               being born in Australia (OR 2.0, 95\% CI 1.2-3.2, P=.006),
               having a self-reported eating disorder (OR 2.4, 95\% CI 1.5-3.9,
               P<.001), being a victim of bullying (OR 1.7, CI 1.3-2.3,

               a need to ensure that this social media content portrays
               responsible health messages and to research further the role of

              are not classified as independent entities. The term orthorexia
              comes from the Greek word orthos (straight, proper) and orexia
              (appetite). It is characterized by the pathological obsession for
              biologically pure food, which leads to important dietary
              restrictions. Orthorexic patients exclude foods from their diets
              that they consider to be impure because they have herbicides,
              pesticides or artificial substances and they worry in excess
              about the techniques and materials used in the food elaboration.
              This obsession leads to loss of social relationships and
              affective dissatisfactions which, in turn, favors obsessive
              concern about food. In orthorexia, that patient initially wants

              programs. These lesions are not directly visible by regular
              flexible bronchoscopes as they are usually distal to the lobar
              and segmental bronchi. Traditionally, depending on location and
              clinical stage at presentation, these lesions were typically
              sampled by computerized tomography (CT) guided needle or surgical
              biopsy although some centers also used ultrasound and fluoroscopy
              guided percutaneous needle biopsy. Due to lack of direct
              visualization, the yield for bronchoscopic guided sampling
              especially of the small <2 cm pulmonary nodules was very low.
              Therefore, sampling has been preferentially performed by
              percutaneous CT guidance, which had high yield of above 90\% but
              it comes at the cost of higher risk complications like
              pneumothorax with reported rate of 15\% to 28\%. Directly
              proceeding to surgical resection is also considered in
              appropriate candidates with high suspicion of malignancy without
              any evidence of distant metastasis but the proportion of such
              cases of lung cancer is low. The manuscript discussed the various
              bronchoscopic diagnostic modalities for peripheral pulmonary
              lesions. It is important to note that most of the studies in this
              field are relatively small, not randomized, suffer from selection
              bias, have considerable heterogeneity in sampling
              methodology/instruments and usually have been performed in high
              volume institutions by dedicated highly experienced
              proceduralists. The prevalence of malignancy in most of the
              reported cohorts has also been high which may result in higher
              diagnostic yields. All these factors need to be kept in mind
              before generalizing the results to individual centers and
              practices.",

              Adenocarcinoma is now the prevailing histopathological sub-type
              of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) resulting in more
              peripheral cancers. Conventional bronchoscopy is often not
              sufficient to obtain adequate tissue samples for diagnosis.
              Radiologically guided transthoracic biopsy is a sensitive
              alternative, but carries significant risks. These limitations
              have driven the development of complimentary bronchoscopic
              navigation techniques for peripheral tumour localisation and
              sampling. Furthermore, linear endobronchial ultrasound with
              transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is increasingly
              being chosen as the initial diagnostic procedure for those with
              central lesions and/or radiological evidence of node-positive

              percutaneous coronary intervention (R-PCI) for the treatment of
              coronary artery disease (CAD) in clinical practice, especially in
              complex lesions, and to determine the safety and clinical success
              of R-PCI compared with manual percutaneous coronary intervention
              (M-PCI). BACKGROUND: R-PCI is safe and feasible for simple
              coronary lesions. The utility of R-PCI for complex coronary
              lesions is unknown. METHODS: All consecutive PCI procedures
              performed robotically (study group) or manually (control group)
              over 18 months were included. R-PCI technical success, defined as
              the completion of the procedure robotically or with partial
              manual assistance and without a major adverse cardiovascular
              event, was determined. Procedures ineligible for R-PCI (i.e.,
              atherectomy, planned 2-stent strategy for bifurcation lesion,
              chronic total occlusion requiring hybrid approach) were excluded
              for analysis from the M-PCI group. Clinical success, defined as
              completion of the PCI procedure without a major adverse
              cardiovascular event, procedure time, stent use, and fluoroscopy
              time were compared between groups. RESULTS: A total of 315
              patients (mean age 67.7 $\pm$ 11.8 years; 78\% men) underwent 334
              PCI procedures (108 R-PCIs, 157 lesions, 78.3\% type B2/C; 226
              M-PCIs, 336 lesions, 68.8\% type B2/C). Technical success with
              R-PCI was 91.7\% (rate of manual assistance 11.1\%, rate of
              manual conversion 7.4\%, rate of major adverse cardiovascular
              events 0.93\%). Clinical success (99.1\% with R-PCI vs. 99.1\%
              with M-PCI; p = 1.00), stent use (stents per procedure 1.59 $\pm$
              0.79 with R-PCI vs. 1.54 $\pm$ 0.75 with M-PCI; p = 0.73), and
              fluoroscopy time (18.2 $\pm$ 10.4 min with R-PCI vs. 19.2 $\pm$
              11.4 min with M-PCI; p = 0.39) were similar between the groups,
              although procedure time was longer in the R-PCI group (44:30
              $\pm$ 26:04 min:s vs. 36:34 $\pm$ 23:03 min:s; p = 0.002).
              Propensity-matched analysis confirmed that procedure time was
              longer in the robotic group (42:59 $\pm$ 26:14 min:s with R-PCI
              vs. 34:01 $\pm$ 17:14 min:s with M-PCI; p = 0.007), although
              clinical success remained similar (98.8\% with R-PCI vs. 100\%

              78-year-old man underwent robot-assisted EVAR of a 5.9-cm

              successfully navigate through the aneurysm sac, cannulate the

              may be difficult percutaneously to position an active electrode.
              Such patients are more optimally treated with SRS. In certain

              members, and healthcare providers to create quality improvement
              initiatives targeting identified issues. Three focus groups were
              conducted: 1) patient and family member-specific, 2) healthcare
              provider-specific, and 3) all participants (including patients,
              family members and healthcare providers). Discussion questions
              were focused around current educational resources, barriers
              encountered throughout the cancer continuum, and recommendations
              for improvement. Six themes emerged from the two initial focus
              groups with patients and family members and healthcare providers:
              1) patient-provider communication, 2) accessing information, 3)
              tailored information, 4) side effect information, 5) caregiver
              information, and 6) partners in care. Themes were presented to
              participants to ensure findings accurately depicted their
              experience and five quality improvement projects were created,
              aligning with the themes. This study provides an example of how
              EBCD helped to foster a safe environment, where patients, family
              members, and healthcare providers worked together in order to
              improve educational resources.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated
              that low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening reduces lung
              cancer mortality in a high-risk U.S. population. A
              microsimulation model of LDCT screening was developed to estimate
              the impact of introducing population-based screening in Canada.
              DATA AND METHODS: LDCT screening was simulated using the lung
              cancer module of the Cancer Risk Management Model (CRMM-LC),
              which generates large, representative samples of the Canadian
              population from which a cohort with characteristics similar to
              NLST participants was selected. Screening parameters were
              estimated for stage shift, LDCT sensitivity and specificity, lead
              time, and survival to fit to NLST incidence and mortality
              results. The estimation process was a step-wise directed search.
              RESULTS: Simulated mortality reduction from LDCT screening was
              23\% in the CRMM-LC, compared with 20\% in the NLST. The
              difference in the number of lung cancer cases over six years
              varied by, at most, 2.3\% in the screen arm. The difference in
              cumulative incidence at six years was less than 2\% in both
              screen and control arms. The estimated percentage over-diagnosed
              was 24.8\%, which was 6\% higher than NLST results.
              INTERPRETATION: Simulated screening reproduces NLST results. The
              CRMM-LC can evaluate a variety of population-based screening
              strategies. Sensitivity analyses are recommended to provide a
              range of projections to reflect model uncertainty.",

              Improving the awareness of the risk of lung cancer and warning
              symptoms, recognition and prompt referral, and screening with low
              dose computed tomography (LDCT) are potential ways to improve
              early diagnosis. Currently the evidence is strongest for LDCT,
              where one large trial, the US National Lung Screening Trial
              (NLST), showed a 20\% relative reduction in lung cancer-related
              mortality and a 6.7\% reduction in all-cause mortality in
              patients who had LDCT compared with chest X-ray. Although many

              Force rated low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) for lung cancer
              screening as level 'B' recommendation. Yet, lung cancer screening
              implementation remains controversial, particularly when
              considering its cost-effectiveness. The aim of this work is to
              investigate the cost-effectiveness of LDCT screening program for
              lung cancer by performing a systematic literature review.
              METHODS: We reviewed the published economic evaluations of LDCT
              in lung cancer screening. MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science and
              Cochrane databases were searched for literature retrieval up to
              31 March 2015. Inclusion criteria included: studies reporting an
              original full economic evaluation; reports presenting the
              outcomes as Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) gained or as Life
              Years Gained. RESULTS: Nine economic evaluations met the
              inclusion criteria. All the cost-effectiveness analyses included
              high risk populations for lung cancer and compared the use of
              annual LDCT screening with no screening. Seven studies reported
              an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio below the threshold of
              US\$ 100 000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness of
              LDCT screening for lung cancer is an highly debatable issue.
              Currently available economic evaluations suggest the
              cost-effectiveness of LDCT for lung cancer screening compared
              with no screening and indicate that the implementation of LDCT
              should be considered when planning a national lung cancer

              undertaken to identify primary studies and systematic reviews.
              Information on the efficacy and safety of LS versus OS was
              analysed. A meta-analysis was conducted to examine long-term
              outcomes. RESULTS: A systematic review published in 2000 and 12
              more recent randomized clinical trials were identified. Compared
              with OS, LS reduced blood loss and pain, and resulted in a faster
              return of bowel function and earlier resumption of normal diet.
              Hospital stay was up to 2 days shorter after LS. No significant
              differences between the techniques were noted in the incidence of
              complications or postoperative mortality. The time required to
              complete LS was significantly longer (0.5-1.0 h more). No

              States representing 36.8\% (2573 million people) and 34.2\% (2393
              million people) of the global population of 7001 million people,

              of patients with a tracheostomy was statistically less than the
              hospital mortality of patients not receiving a tracheostomy
              (13.7\% vs. 26.4\%; p = .048), despite having a similar severity
              of illness at the time of admission to the ICU (Acute Physiology

              Similarly, the average duration of intensive care was
              significantly longer among the hospital nonsurvivors receiving a

              the 44 survivors receiving a tracheostomy in the ICU, 38 (86.4\%)
              were alive 30 days after hospital discharge and 31 (70.5\%) were

              Current guidelines are concerned primarily with safety aspects of
              the procedure. In view of this, and the authors' own observations
              of individual variation in preparation and technique, a national
              survey of bronchoscopic procedure was performed to assess
              physicians' methods. A structured questionnaire was mailed to 547
              consultant physicians in adult respiratory medicine. Physicians'
              routines of patient preparation, drug therapy, sampling methods,
              and experience of complications with the flexible bronchoscope
              were assessed. A 60\% response (328 physicians) was obtained.
              Patient consent was obtained by a junior doctor in 31\% of
              replies. 205 (63\%) physicians gave benzodiazepine sedation, 46
              (14\%) used opioid, and 38 (12\%) administered both. Ninety-four
              (29\%) physicians prescribed an antimuscarinic agent, and 235
              (74\%) gave antibiotics to patients with mechanical heart valves.
              Only 22\% of physicians monitored electrocardiogram and 10\%
              monitored blood pressure during all procedures. Marked variance
              was noted in sampling routines of suspected lung tumours.
              Physicians who used fluoroscopic guidance for transbronchial lung
              biopsy reported a significantly lower incidence of pneumothorax
              requiring drain insertion over the previous 12 months compared to
              those who did not (2.68 of 1000 versus 9.17 of 1000, (p<0.03)),
              but no difference in the total incidence of pneumothorax. Only 87
              (27\%) of responders had performed transbronchial needle
              aspiration sampling over the previous 12 months. The preparation
              and practice of flexible bronchoscopy varies greatly for each
              physician. Use of radiographical screening for performing
              transbronchial lung biopsy was associated with a lower likelihood
              of pneumothorax requiring chest tube drainage.",

              the use of a video double-lumen tube reduced the need for
              fiberoptic bronchoscopy for (1) verification of initial tube
              placement and for (2) reverification of correct placement after
              repositioning for thoracotomy. DESIGN: A single-center
              retrospective study. SETTING: Thoracic surgery in a medical
              university hospital. PARTICIPANTS \& INTERVENTIONS: After
              institutional review board approval, 29 patients who underwent
              thoracic surgical procedures using video double-lumen tubes were
              included in the final retrospective analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND
              MAIN RESULTS: For 27 (93.2\%) patients, the use of fiberoptic
              bronchoscopy was not needed either for initial placement or for
              verification of correct video double-lumen tube placement upon
              final positioning of the patient. However, for two patients,
              fiberoptic bronchoscopy was needed: for (1) one patient with
              severe left mainstem bronchus distortion as a result of a large
              left upper lobe tumor, and (2) a second patient with secretions
              that were difficult to clear. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates
              that the video double-lumen tube requires significantly less
              (6.8\%) fiberoptic use for both initial placement and
              verification of final position, in stark contrast to standard
              practice in which bronchoscopy is always used to verify final
              positioning of the double-lumen tube. As opposed to intermittent
              bronchoscopy, the continuous visualization offered by an embedded
              camera may confer an added measure of safety.",

              have changed over the last several years. We performed a survey
              to assess the current practice of tracheostomy in German
              intensive care units (ICUs). METHODS: A postal questionnaire was
              sent to the head physicians of 513 German ICUs, excluding
              pediatric ICUs. RESULTS: We obtained responses from 455 of the
              513 ICUs (89\%). In 90\% of the ICUs, tracheostomies were
              performed during the first 14 d of mechanical ventilation.
              Eighty-six percent of the ICUs routinely performed percutaneous
              dilatational tracheostomy; the modified Ciaglia technique was the
              most popular percutaneous technique (69\%). The majority (98\%)
              of the percutaneous procedures were performed under bronchoscopic
              control. Surgical tracheostomy is usually performed in the
              operating room (72\%) by a surgeon (61\%), whereas percutaneous
              dilatational tracheostomies are usually performed at the
              patient's bedside in the ICU (98\%) by an intensivist (93\%).
              Tracheostomized patients were followed up routinely in 26\% of
              the ICUs, and in 45\% of the ICUs there were guidelines regarding
              the indication, the timing and the technique of tracheostomy.
              CONCLUSION: Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy is the
              procedure of choice for tracheostomy in critically ill patients
              in Germany. The modified Ciaglia technique is the preferred
              percutaneous technique, and nearly all physicians routinely use
              bronchoscopic guidance. Most tracheostomies are done during the
              second week of mechanical ventilation.",

              thoracic endovascular repair (TEVAR) of blunt thoracic aortic
              injuries (BTAIs). Late results remain ill-defined. The purpose of
              this study is to review the midterm results of our experience
              with endovascular repair of BTAIs. METHODS: A retrospective
              analysis was performed reviewing all endovascular repairs of
              BTAIs from 2002 to present. Preoperative, operative, and
              postoperative variables were recorded. Clinical end points
              included aortic-related mortality, stroke and paraplegia,
              hospital length of stay, procedure-related complications,
              endoleaks, and reinterventions. Computed tomography data sets
              were postprocessed for assessing integrity of stent grafts and
              late complications. RESULTS: A total of 24 cases of BTAIs treated
              with TEVAR were identified. Thoracic endovascular repair was
              successful in treating BTAIs in all patients and there were no
              instances of procedure-related death, stroke, or paraplegia. One
              access complication occurred, requiring an iliofemoral bypass.
              Actuarial survival estimates and freedom from reintervention at 5
              years were 88.7\% and 95.8\%, respectively. No late endoleaks,
              stent fractures, or device migration were identified. One patient
              required a secondary intervention 1 year following the initial
              repair to treat a pseudocoarctation syndrome caused by a
              diaphragm at the distal half of the stented aorta. This was

              Thoracic endovascular repair for BTAIs can be performed safely
              with low periprocedural mortality and morbidity. Midterm
              follow-up data presented in this report further support the

              managing patient flow, effective January 2005, served as a call
              to action for hospitals, yet many hospitals still lack the
              processes and structures to admit or transfer patients to an
              inpatient bed on a timely basis. In 2007 the University of
              Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) at Shadyside, a 526-bed tertiary
              care hospital, began testing and implementing real-time demand
              capacity management (RTDC) at an initial pilot site. The hospital
              had identified improved patient flow as a strategic goal in 2002,
              but a series of patient flow projects failed to result in
              improvement.Implementing RTDC: Standard processes for the four
              RTDC steps---Predicting Capacity, Predicting Demand, Developing a
              Plan, and Evaluating a Plan---and standard structures for unit
              bed huddles and the hospital bed meetings were developed. The
              neurosurgery (NS) service line's ICU and stepdown unit were
              designated as the first pilot sites, but work was quickly spread
              to other units.Results: Improvements were achieved and have been
              sustained through early 2011 for all measures, including (1) the
              unit-based reliability of discharge predictions; (2) overnight
              holds in the postanesthesia care unit, a problem eliminated two
              months after RTDC work began; (3) the percentage of patients who
              left without being seen (LWBS), routinely < 0.5\% by May 2008;
              (5) the emergency department median length of stay for admitted
              patients, routinely < 4 hours after March 2008; and (6) aggregate
              length of stay (ALOS), generally maintained at < 5.75
              days.Conclusions: RTDC represents a promising approach to
              improving hospitalwide patient flow. Its four steps, integrated

              years, with a 90-day history of suicide attempt, a current
              diagnosis of depressive disorder (96.0\% had major depressive

              on suicide prevention, or their combination (Comb), at five
              academic sites. Treatment assignment could be either random or
              chosen by study participants. Intent-to-treat, mixed effects
              regression models of depression and other relevant ratings were
              estimated. Improvement and remission rates were computed with the
              last observation carried forward. RESULTS: Most patients (n = 104
              or 84\%) chose treatment assignment, and overall, three fourths
              (n = 93) received Comb. In Comb, CDRS-R declined from a baseline
              adjusted mean of 49.6 (SD 12.3) to 38.3 (8.0) at week 12 and to
              27.0 (10.1) at week 24 (p < .0001), with a Clinical Global
              Impression -defined improvement rate of 58.0\% at week 12 and
              72.2\% at week 24 and a remission (CDRS-R $\leq$ 28) rate of

  author   = "Franc-Law, Jeffrey M and Bullard, Micheal J and Della Corte, F",
  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Although most hospitals have an emergency
              department disaster plan, most never have been implemented in a
              true disaster or been tested objectively. Computer simulation may
              be a useful tool to predict emergency department patient flow
              during a disaster. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare
              the accuracy of a computer simulation in predicting emergency
              department patient flow during a mass-casualty incident with that
              of a real-time, virtual, live exercise. METHODS: History,
              physical examination findings, and laboratory results for 136
              simulated patients were extracted from the disastermed.ca patient
              database as used as input into a computer simulation designed to
              represent the emergency department at the University of Alberta
              Hospital. The computer simulation was developed using a
              commercially available simulation software platform (2005,
              SimProcess, CACI Products, San Diego CA). Patient flow parameters
              were compared to a previous virtual, live exercise using the same
              data set. RESULTS: Although results between the computer
              simulation and the live exercise appear similar, they differ
              statistically with respect to many patient benchmarks. There was
              a marked difference between the triage codes assigned during the
              live exercise and those from the patient database; however, this
              alone did not account for the differences between the patient
              groups. It is likely that novel approaches to patient care
              developed by the live exercise group, which are difficult to
              model by computer software, contributed to differences between
              the groups. Computer simulation was useful, however, in
              predicting how small changes to emergency department structure,
              such as adding staff or patient care areas, can influence patient
              flow. CONCLUSIONS: Computer simulation is helpful in defining the
              effects of changes to a hospital disaster plan. However, it
              cannot fully replace participant exercises. Rather, computer
              simulation and live exercises are complementary, and both may be
              useful for disaster plan evaluation.",

  abstract = "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Since its inception in early 2000, robotic
              assistance with urologic procedures continues to expand. The
              magnification, three-dimensional visualization, and surgical
              control offered by the latest daVinci Si-HD system has led to its
              integration into microsurgical procedures for male infertility.
              The addition of robotic assistance may allow an improvement in
              outcomes similar to when the operating microscope was introduced
              in microsurgery. Though the use of robotics in microsurgery is
              still in its early phases, initial findings are encouraging.
              RECENT FINDINGS: This review covers robotic microsurgical
              procedures and tools for infertility and chronic
              orchialgia/testicular pain such as vasovasostomy,
              vasoepididymostomy, varicocelectomy, testicular sperm extraction
              and targeted denervation of the spermatic cord. Preliminary human
              clinical studies appear to show improved operative efficiency and
              comparable outcomes. The use of robotic assistance during robotic
              microsurgical vasovasostomy appears to decrease operative
              duration and improve the rate of return of postoperative sperm
              counts compared to the pure microsurgical technique. SUMMARY:
              Long-term prospective controlled trials are necessary to assess
              the true benefit for robotic-assisted microsurgery. The

              robotic systems, particularly the da Vinci robot system more than
              10 years ago, thoracic operations have been performed with some
              provocative results and limited, defined advantages. The present
              review provides an overview of common thoracic surgical
              procedures performed with the robotic system and discusses the
              anesthetic implications. RECENT FINDINGS: The literature on this
              topic currently includes case reports or series of clinically
              prospective or retrospective observational reports with the use
              of robotic systems, involving the thoracic cavity (mediastinal
              mass resections, lobectomies, and esophagectomies); unfortunately
              there are very limited reports related to anesthetic implications
              or complications related to the use of this technology. The
              majority of the surgical reports involve the use of lung
              isolation devices for thoracic surgery, specifically the use of a
              double-lumen endotracheal tube (DLT); a few centers use carbon
              dioxide (CO2) insufflation as part of their management to achieve
              maximal surgical exposure while compressing the operative side of
              the lung away from the operative area. SUMMARY: Anesthesiologists
              must be familiar with lung isolation techniques and flexible

              or nerve damage, must be sought. Because the potential for

                 OBJECTIVE: To determine swallowing, speech, and QOL outcomes
                 following transoral robotic surgery (TORS) for OPSCC. DESIGN,
                 PARTICIPANTS, AND SETTING: This prospective cohort study of 81
                 patients with previously untreated OPSCC was conducted at a
                 tertiary care academic comprehensive cancer center.
                 INTERVENTIONS: Primary surgical resection via TORS and neck
                 dissection as indicated. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patients
                 were asked to complete the Head and Neck Cancer Inventory
                 (HNCI) preoperatively and at 3 weeks as well as 3, 6, and 12
                 months postoperatively. Swallowing ability was assessed by
                 independence from a gastrostomy tube (G-tube).
                 Clinicopathologic and follow-up data were also collected.
                 RESULTS: Mean follow-up time was 22.7 months. The HNCI
                 response rates at 3 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months were 79\%,
                 60\%, 63\%, and 67\% respectively. There were overall declines
                 in speech, eating, aesthetic, social, and overall QOL domains
                 in the early postoperative periods. However, at 1 year post
                 TORS, scores for aesthetic, social, and overall QOL remained
                 high. Radiation therapy was negatively correlated with
                 multiple QOL domains (P 1 oropharyngeal site resected) and age
                 older than 55 years predicted the need for a G-tube at any
                 point after TORS (P < .05 for both). CONCLUSIONS AND
                 RELEVANCE: Patients with OPSCC treated with TORS maintain a
                 high QOL at 1 year after surgery. Adjuvant treatment and older
                 age tend to decrease QOL. Patients meeting these criteria

              widely performed and investigated of these techniques. Microwave
              ablation (MWA) represents a relatively new alternative that
              shares the same indications and is conducted in a very similar
              fashion as RFA. It has been experimentally and clinically shown
              that MWA produces larger, more spherical ablation zones over
              shorter periods of time compared to RFA. Seven different MWA
              systems are available in Europe and the USA with significant
              differences in the size and shape of the produced ablation zones.
              Results The types of complications caused by MWA and their rates
              of occurrence are very similar to those caused by RFA. The local
              progression rates after MWA of lung malignancies vary between 0
              \% and 34 \% and are similar to those in the RFA literature.
              Conclusion Despite technical improvements, the current generation
              of MWA systems has comparable clinical outcomes to those of RFA.
              Key Points · MWA is a safe technique that should be considered
              one of the treatment options for medically inoperable lung
              tumors. · As thermal ablations of lung tumors are becoming more
              frequent, radiologists should be acquainted with the
              post-ablation imaging characteristics. · Although MWA has some
              theoretical advantages over RFA, the clinical outcomes are
              similar. Citation Format · Vogl TJ, Nour-Eldin NA, Albrecht M et

              therapies include stereotactic ablation radiotherapy (SABR) and
              thermal ablative therapies through percutaneously inserted

              the potential treatment. To do this, contrast-enhanced computed
              tomography (CT) of the lower neck, chest and upper abdomen should
              be available for most patients at the first clinical assessment.
              At this time, performance status is recorded and blood tests and

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: A definitive and specific diagnosis of interstitial
              lung disease (ILD) often requires a histologic analysis of the
              lung parenchyma. A transbronchial biopsy with forceps has a
              limited diagnostic yield for idiopathic interstitial pneumonias.
              The incorporation of a transbronchial lung cryobiopsy for
              diagnosing ILD appears to be very promising, although there are
              only a few published studies in this regard. Our paper shows the
              results of using this technique in our center. METHODS: This was
              a prospective study including 55 patients with ILD diagnosed from
              January 2012 to January 2015. The methodology used, the overall
              diagnostic yield, and the number and the location of samples, in
              addition to complications, have been reported. RESULTS: In 38
              (69\%), 10 (20.8\%), and 7 (12.7\%) cases, we obtained a certain,
              highly likely, and unclassifiable diagnosis of interstitial
              pneumonia, respectively. With 18 cases, usual interstitial
              pneumonia was the most common diagnosis. The most common
              complication was a pneumothorax in 8 patients (14.5\%).
              CONCLUSIONS: A transbronchial lung cryobiopsy using a flexible
              cryoprobe has a good diagnostic yield and might be an alternative
              to consider in cases of diffuse ILD in which a histologic sample

              screening programs. The decision to implement such programs
              should be informed by data on resource utilization and costs.
              METHODS: Resource utilization data were collected prospectively
              from 2059 participants in the Pan-Canadian Early Detection of
              Lung Cancer Study using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT).
              Participants who had 2\% or greater lung cancer risk over 3 years
              using a risk prediction tool were recruited from seven major
              cities across Canada. A cost analysis was conducted from the
              Canadian public payer's perspective for resources that were used
              for the screening and treatment of lung cancer in the initial
              years of the study. RESULTS: The average per-person cost for
              screening individuals with LDCT was \$453 (95\% confidence
              interval [CI], \$400-\$505) for the initial 18-months of
              screening following a baseline scan. The screening costs were
              highly dependent on the detected lung nodule size, presence of
              cancer, screening intervention, and the screening center. The
              mean per-person cost of treating lung cancer with curative
              surgery was \$33,344 (95\% CI, \$31,553-\$34,935) over 2 years.
              This was lower than the cost of treating advanced-stage lung
              cancer with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or supportive care alone,
              (\$47,792; 95\% CI, \$43,254-\$52,200; p = 0.061). CONCLUSION: In
              the Pan-Canadian study, the average cost to screen individuals
              with a high risk for developing lung cancer using LDCT and the
              average initial cost of curative intent treatment were lower than

              efficacy of the second-generation robotic-assisted system CorPath
              GRX (Corindus) for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
              BACKGROUND: The first-generation CorPath 200 robotic-assisted
              system for PCI is effective, but is limited by the lack of an
              active robotic guide-catheter control. The CorPath GRX device
              enables robotic guide-catheter manipulation, in addition to
              guidewire and balloon/stent delivery. However, there have been no
              clinical data reported with this device. METHODS: Consecutive
              patients with demonstrated obstructive coronary artery disease
              (>70\% stenosis) and clinical indications for PCI were treated
              with the CorPath GRX system and enrolled in the study. The two
              co-primary endpoints were clinical procedural success (final TIMI
              3 flow, and <30\% residual stenosis without in-hospital major
              adverse cardiac event) and device technical success (robotic
              clinical procedural success without the need for unplanned manual
              assistance/conversion). RESULTS: The study enrolled 40 subjects
              (65.7 $\pm$ 11.9 years; 72.5\% males; 54 lesions) with a high
              proportion of American College of Cardiology/American Heart
              Association type B2/C lesions (77.8\%). Clinical procedural
              success and device technical success rates were 97.5\% (n = 39 of
              40) and 90.0\% (n = 36 of 40), respectively. CONCLUSION: The
              second-generation CorPath GRX system for robotic-assisted PCI is
              safe and effective, and achieves high rates of clinical and
              technical success in a cohort of patients with complex coronary

              of 40 patients who enrolled in the PRECISE study and had PCI with
              the CorPath 200 robotic system (Corindus Vascular Robotics) were
              compared to 80 consecutive patients who underwent conventional
              PCI. All patients had obstructive coronary artery disease,
              evidence of myocardial ischemia, and clinical indications for
              single-vessel PCI. Baseline demographics of the 40 robotic and 80
              traditional PCIs were similar. Only 2 robotic-assisted cases
              required conversion to manual PCI. All patients had a final
              residual stenosis <30\%. Robotic-enhanced PCI was associated with

              contours. It is reported that, when these contours participate in
              certain larger arrangements, there is an abrupt point at which
              the percept changes as a function of dot spacing (or density
              along the contour). Closely spaced arrangements give rise to
              subjective effects involving apparent brightness and depth,
              whereas sparsely spaced ones do not. The effects are most clear
              in configurations that involve endpoints and possible occlusions.
              For these configurations, densely dotted contours are
              perceptually equivalent to solid ones, but sparse ones are not.
              This change in percept occurs abruptly and consistently at a dot
              to space ratio of 1:5, when the dot density is normalized by dot
              size, and this point is called the size/spacing constraint. It
              holds only for dots of the order of 1 min visual angle in
              diameter when small to modest contrast values are used. The
              subjective effects are not present for dotted contours (or even
              for solid ones) that are smaller (less than 0.5 min), and differ
              for contours that are larger (greater than 10 min). To
              demonstrate the significance of size/spacing constraints for
              early vision, a framework for grouping consisting of processes at
              many different levels is outlined, and the requirements for the
              earliest one (orientation selection) are sketched in greater
              detail. The size/spacing constraint follows directly from one of
              these requirements--receptive field structure--and seems to

              a manipulandum (motor) connected to the forearm to one of seven
              levels ranging in a geometric series from 12 to 800 N.s/m. During
              each condition the viscosity of the motor was held constant by a
              computer while subjects tracked, by moving their forearm in the
              sagittal plane, a visually presented target whose position
              changed randomly every 1.5 s for 255 s. Nonparametric and
              parametric impulse response functions were calculated between the
              input (target) and output (position) in each tracking condition.
              Nonparametric analyses revealed that subjects became sluggish at
              higher viscosities (above 200 N.s/m) and took longer to reach the
              target. A second-order low-pass transfer function was found to
              provide a very good description of tracking performance at each
              viscous level. The gain and damping parameter of this transfer

              trade-off in terms of determining an optimal level of

              learning generalizes, such that movements in novel situations are

              of generalization for visuomotor rotation learning changes when
              training movements are made to a wide distribution of directions.
              Here we have found that for dynamics learning, the shape of the
              generalization gradient is not similarly modifiable by the extent
              of training within the workspace. Subjects learned to control a

              directions increased, the extent of generalization was reduced.
              When training involved multiple targets throughout the workspace,
              the extent of generalization was no greater than following
              training to the nearest target alone. Thus a wide range of
              experience compensating for a dynamics perturbation provided no

  author   = "Rowe, Rosemary and Calnan, Michael",
  abstract = "Trust has traditionally been considered a cornerstone of
              effective doctor--patient relationships. The need for
              interpersonal trust relates to the vulnerability associated with
              being ill, the information asymmetries arising from the
              specialist nature of medical knowledge, and the uncertainty and
              element of risk regarding the competence and intentions of the
              practitioner on whom the patient is dependent. Without trust
              patients may well not access services at all, let alone disclose
              all medically relevant information. Trust is also important at an
              institutional level, as trust in particular hospitals, insurers
              and health care systems may affect patient support for and use of
              services and thus their economic and political viability.
              However, in our so-called post-traditional order1 is trust still
              necessary? The days of `doctor knows best' when patients blindly
              trusted in and deferred to medical expertize are fast becoming a
              distant memory in industrialized societies where the consumer is
              dubbed `king' and where the `expert patient' expects to play an
              active part in decision-making regarding their treatment. Might
              lower levels of trust, or in fact distrust, be merited in light
              of medical errors, drug side effects, and the slow adoption of
              `evidence-based' medical innovations and clinical guidelines? In
              this paper we set out how and why trust relations in the
              healthcare context are changing, arguing that although trust may
              now be more conditional it is still vitally important for both
              health care providers and institutions. Trust relationships are
              characterized by one party, the trustor, having positive
              expectations regarding both the competence of the other party,
              the trustee, and that they will work in their best interests.2 In
              the context of healthcare there have been changes to both
              interpersonal trust relations and to institutional trust
              relations. Traditionally, patients have placed high levels of

              show that the pattern of kinematic error observed in studies of
              dynamics learning is associated with this anisotropic impedance
              pattern. We also show that the magnitude of kinematic error
              associated with this anisotropy dictates the amount of motor
              learning and, consequently, the extent to which dynamics learning
              generalizes. Subjects were trained to reach to visual targets
              while holding a robotic device that applied forces during
              movement. On infrequent trials, the load was removed and the
              resulting kinematic error was measured. We found a strong
              correlation between the pattern of kinematic error and the
              anisotropic pattern of hand stiffness. In a second experiment
              subjects were trained under force-field conditions to move in two
              directions: one in which the dynamic perturbation was in the
              direction of maximum arm impedance and the associated kinematic
              error was low and another in which the perturbation was in the
              direction of low impedance where kinematic error was high.
              Generalization of learning was assessed in a reference direction
              that lay intermediate to the two training directions. We found
              that transfer of learning was greater when training occurred in
              the direction associated with the larger kinematic error. This
              suggests that the anisotropic patterns of impedance and kinematic

              processes and certainly speech production involves both auditory
              information and inputs that arise from the muscles and tissues of
              the vocal tract. We previously demonstrated that somatosensory
              inputs associated with facial skin deformation alter the
              perceptual processing of speech sounds. We show here that the
              reverse is also true, that speech sounds alter the perception of
              facial somatosensory inputs. As a somatosensory task, we used a
              robotic device to create patterns of facial skin deformation that
              would normally accompany speech production. We found that the
              perception of the facial skin deformation was altered by speech

              Through systematic review of the literature from a critical
              perspective, four characteristics that either enhance or mitigate
              the influence of medical record structure on patient utilization
              of an electronic patient record (EPR) system have been
              identified: environmental pressures, physician centeredness,
              collaborative organizational culture, and patient centeredness.
              An evaluation framework is proposed for use when considering
              adaptation of existing EPR systems for online patient access.
              Exemplars of patient-accessible EPR systems from the literature
              are evaluated utilizing the framework. From this study, it
              appears that traditional information system research and

              issues that arise when expanding access of EPR systems to

              efficacy and higher risk of bleeding with new oral anticoagulants
              (NOACs) in patients with renal insufficiency. A meta-analysis was
              performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety with recommended
              doses of NOAC compared with conventional treatment in patients
              with renal insufficiency. METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane Library,
              EMBASE, EBSCO, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases were searched
              from January 1, 2001 through March 23, 2014. Randomized
              controlled trials that compared NOACs (rivaroxaban, apixaban, and
              dabigatran) with comparators (vitamin K antagonist/warfarin, low
              molecular weight heparin, aspirin, placebo) were selected. We
              defined moderate renal insufficiency as creatinine clearance
              (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) of 30-49 mL/min,
              and mild renal insufficiency as eGFR 50-79 mL/min. RESULTS: There
              were 40,693 patients with renal insufficiency in 10 trials.
              Compared with other anticoagulants in patients with mild renal
              insufficiency there was significantly less major or clinically
              relevant nonmajor bleeding (odds ratio [OR], 0.81; 95\%
              confidence interval [CI], 0.72-0.90) and stroke or systemic
              embolism (OR, 0.70; 95\% CI, 0.54-0.92) with NOACs. Using random
              effects meta-analysis, there was significantly less stroke or
              systemic embolism (OR, 0.72; 95\% CI, 0.57-0.92) and a trend
              toward less major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (OR,
              0.82; 95\% CI, 0.59-1.14) with the NOACs among patients with
              moderate renal insufficiency, and this became statistically
              significant when evaluated using a fixed effects model. NOACs
              showed efficiency comparable with conventional anticoagulants for
              prevention of venous thromboembolism or related mortality.
              CONCLUSIONS: In patients with renal insufficiency, recommended

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: At any given time, 14\% of Canadian children
              experience clinically significant mental disorders, which
              frequently persist into adulthood. Canadian public policy has
              emphasized specialized treatment services, yet these services
              only reach 25\% of children with disorders. Prevention programs
              hold potential to reduce the number of children with disorders in
              the population. To inform policy-making, we systematically
              reviewed the best available research evidence on programs for
              preventing conduct disorder (CD), anxiety and depression, three
              of the most prevalent mental disorders in children. METHODS: We
              systematically identified and reviewed randomized controlled
              trials (RCTs) on programs intended to prevent CD, anxiety and
              depression in children aged 0-18 years. RESULTS: Fifteen RCTs met
              selection criteria: nine (on eight programs) for preventing CD;
              one for anxiety; four (on three programs) for depression; and one
              for all three. Ten RCTs demonstrated significant reductions in
              child symptom and/or diagnostic measures at follow-up. The most
              noteworthy programs, for CD, targeted at-risk children in the
              early years using parent training (PT) or child social skills
              training (SST); for anxiety, employed universal
              cognitive-behavioural training (CBT) in school-age children; and
              for depression, targeted at-risk school-age children, also using
              CBT. Effect sizes for these noteworthy programs were modest but
              consequential. There were few Canadian studies and few that
              evaluated costs. DISCUSSION: Prevention programs are promising
              but replication RCTs are needed to determine effectiveness and
              cost-effectiveness in Canadian settings. Four program types
              should be priorities for replication: targeted PTand child SST
              for preventing CD in children's early years; and universal and
              targeted CBTfor preventing anxiety and depression in children's
              school-age years. Conducting RCTs through research-policy
              partnerships would enable implementation in realistic settings
              while ensuring rigorous evaluation. Prevention merits new policy
              and research investments as part of a comprehensive public health

              Material and Methods 31 wrists in 31 patients (mean age 44 years)
              with malunion of the distal radius after a Colles fracture were
              treated with a corrective osteotomy. The patients were divided on
              basis of effective radio-lunate flexion (ERLF) in the two
              patterns of carpal malalignment. The radiographic changes were
              evaluated. Results There were 20 patients with midcarpal
              malalignment (ERLF $\leq$ 25°) and 11 with radiocarpal
              malalignment (ERLF > 25°). There was a correction of radial tilt
              and ulnar variance in both groups. There was a significant
              improvement of the carpal alignment in the midcarpal malalignment

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Forceps biopsy is the standard procedure to obtain
              specimens in endobronchial lesions. New studies have proposed
              flexible cryoprobe as an accepted alternative method for this
              technique. Although diagnostic use of the cryobiopsy is confirmed
              in few studies, there is paucity of data with regard to an
              optimum protocol for this method since one of the main
              considerations in cryobiopsy is the freezing time. OBJECTIVES: To
              evaluate diagnostic yield and safety of endobronchial biopsies
              using the flexible cryoprobe. Moreover, different freezing times
              were assessed to propose an optimized protocol for this
              diagnostic modality. PATIENTS AND METHODS: For each patient with
              a confirmed intrabronchial lesion, diagnostic o value of forceps
              biopsy, cryobiopsy in three seconds, cryobiopsy in five seconds
              and combined results of cryobiopsy in both timings were recorded.
              RESULTS: A total of 60 patients (39 males and 21 females; Mean
              age 56.7 +/- 13.3) were included. Specimens that were obtained by
              cryobiopsy in five seconds were significantly larger than those
              of forceps biopsy and cryobiopsy in three seconds (p 0.05).
              Simultaneous usage of samples produced in both cryobiopsies can
              significantly improve the diagnostic yield (p = 0.02).
              Statistical analysis showed that there were no significant
              differences in case of bleeding frequency among the three
              sampling methods. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed safety and
              feasibility of cryobiopsy. Additionally, combination of sampling
              with two different cold induction timings would significantly
              increase sensitivity of this emerging technique..",

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Robot-assisted surgery emerged and evolved in order
              to increase the surgical precision and due to the need to
              overcome the drawbacks of conventional minimally invasive
              surgery. In thoracic surgery the first reported use of a robotic
              device was in a series of 12 patients with different lung
              pathologies with the assistance of the DaVinci Robotic Surgical
              System in 2002. The DaVinci system has been used for various
              procedures in the field of thoracic surgery since then. While its
              advantages for the resection of early stage thymoma have been
              well documented, its role in the treatment of lung cancer and
              other pathologies is still under investigation. EVIDENCE
              ACQUISITION: A systematic literature search was performed on the
              following medical databases: Medline, EMBASE and Cochrane
              Library. The search was performed in June 2016 and was limited to
              material published since the first report of a robotic system for
              a surgical procedure in 1985. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The results for
              various thoracic surgical procedures were analyzed with focus on
              the benefits and limitations of the robotic system compared to
              open and thoracoscopic or video-assisted techniques. CONCLUSIONS:
              Although numerous studies have shown the feasibility and safety
              of robotic surgery for various procedures, they were not able to
              show superior postoperative outcomes in terms of morbidity and
              mortality in exchange for the higher costs of robotic surgery
              compared to conventional video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS),
              except for early-stage thymoma resection. Therefore, randomized
              control trials comparing robotic particularly with VATS, but also

              performance of minimally invasive surgical procedures around the
              world. We surveyed opinions about and utilization of
              robot-assisted surgery among urologic surgeons from 44 countries.
              MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 297 surveys were completed from
              September to November 2008 by participating urologic surgeons
              polled at various national and international urologic meetings.
              The survey evaluated surgeon background, personal experience with
              minimally invasive surgery, institutional status regarding
              robotic surgery surgeons' attitudes towards robot-assisted
              surgery, in general, and prostate, bladder and kidney oncologic
              procedures, specifically. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety-seven
              participants completed the survey of which 35\% were in training
              for and 54\% in practice of urology. Although 57\% of these
              participants were older than 40, 62\% had never sat on a robotic
              surgical console but 61\% believed they would perform
              robot-assisted surgery. Seventy-eight percent of respondents felt
              it was required or beneficial to have training in robot-assisted
              surgery. Only 21\% of respondents were currently performing
              robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. Sixty-one percent of
              respondents felt robot-assisted radical prostatectomy was the
              current gold standard or as good as laparoscopic prostatectomy.
              Only 10\% had performed robot-assisted radical cystectomy and
              70\% of these surgeons have transferred skills from
              robot-assisted radical prostectomy. Ten percent were performing
              robot-assisted radical nephrectomies and 30\% had transferred
              skills for laparoscopic partial nephrectomy to robot-assisted
              partial nephrectomy. CONCLUSION: Robot-assisted surgery has begun
              to integrate into the minimally invasive armamentarium for
              urologic surgery and is applied for more procedures as experience
              is gained.",

              have recently been reported, including a robotic transoral
              technique to access the thyroid gland. Herein, we developed a
              robotic transoral periosteal thyroidectomy technique. MATERIALS
              AND METHODS: The da Vinci(\textregistered{}) Surgical System
              (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA) robot was used in two human
              cadavers to perform robotic transoral periosteal thyroidectomies.
              In the first cadaver, the anterior neck was exposed below the
              platysmal muscle. The anatomical spaces and surgical planes were
              observed with four ports by a periosteal approach. In the second
              cadaver, robotic transoral periosteal thyroidectomy was performed
              using three ports. RESULTS: A total thyroidectomy and central
              neck dissection were performed in two cadavers using the da Vinci
              robot with the transoral periosteal approach. Complete
              thyroidectomy and central neck dissection were possible without

              transoral periosteal thyroidectomy provides superior access to
              the thyroid and central neck compartment. Transoral thyroidectomy

              patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation for acute
              respiratory failure and for airway issues. The ideal timing
              (early vs late) and techniques (percutaneous dilatational, other
              new percutaneous techniques, open surgical) for tracheostomy have
              been topics of considerable debate. In this review, we address
              general issues regarding tracheostomy (epidemiology, indications,
              and outcomes) and specifically review the literature regarding
              appropriate timing of tracheostomy tube placement. Based on
              evidence from 2 recent large randomized trials, it is reasonable
              to wait at least 10 d to be certain that a patient has an ongoing
              need for mechanical ventilation before consideration of
              tracheostomy. Percutaneous tracheostomy with flexible
              bronchoscopy guidance is recommended, and optimal percutaneous
              techniques, indications, and contraindications and results in
              high-risk patients (coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, obesity) are
              reviewed. Additional issues related to tracheostomy
              diagnosis-related groups, charges, and procedural costs are
              reviewed. New advances regarding tracheostomy include the use of
              real-time ultrasound guidance for percutaneous tracheostomy in
              high-risk patients. New tracheostomy tubes (tapered with
              low-profile cuffs that fit better on the tapered dilators, longer
              percutaneous tracheostomy tubes) are discussed for optimal use
              with percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy. Two new percutaneous
              techniques, a balloon inflation technique (Dolphin) and the
              PercuTwist procedure, are reviewed. The efficacy of tracheostomy
              teams and tracheostomy hospital services with standardized
              protocols for tracheostomy insertion and care has been associated
              with improved outcomes. Finally, the UK National Tracheostomy
              Safety Project developed standardized resources for education of
              both health care providers and patients, including emergency
              algorithms for tracheostomy incidents, and serves as an excellent

  abstract = "Bronchoscopes have markedly improved the diagnosis as well as
              therapy in pediatric pulmonary disorders. Two types of
              bronchoscopes are available; flexible and rigid, with their own
              advantages and disadvantages. Depending on the clinical need and
              availability of skills, choice is made between the two.
              Typically, rigid scopes are largely used by the surgeons
              (pediatric or otolayngologists) while flexible bronchoscope stays
              in the domain of the pediatric pulmonologist and intensivists.
              Rigid scopes may be more versatile than flexible bronchoscopes in
              removing the foreign bodies from the airway. Flexible
              bronchoscopes on the other hand can even be introduced through an
              endotracheal tube. At times, use of both scopes may be required
              in a given patient for optimal results. Bronchoscopes give us a
              means to visualize the inside of the airway, which can be very
              informative for assessing various pathologies affecting the
              airways. Apart from the visualization of the parts of the airway
              tree and their structure as well as patency, it can also be used
              to take tissue biopsy specimens, collect secretions from the
              airways and bronchoalveolar lavage which can also get cellular
              elements from the distal alveoli. In the past few decades, more
              and more instruments are being used for expanding the utility of
              flexible bronchoscope for interventions ranging from bronchial
              toilet, foreign body removal, airway stenting and lasers or
              cryotherapy for airway lesions. The perinatologists have opened

              patients treated by internists at a 647-bed rural community
              hospital. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The 443 patients in the
              hospitalists' 10 most common diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) were
              compared with 1,681 patients in the same DRGs who were cared for
              by internists in fiscal year 1998. Length of stay, cost of care,
              patient illness severity, patient satisfaction, 30-day
              readmission rate, inpatient mortality, discharge status, and
              resource utilization were compared. RESULTS: The hospitalists'
              patients had a shorter mean ($\pm$ SD) length of stay (4.1 $\pm$
              3.0 days versus 5.5 $\pm$ 4.9 days, P <0.001) and their cost of
              care was less than that of the internists' patients ($4,098 \pm
              $2,455 versus $4,658 \pm $4,084, P <0.001). Analyses that
              adjusted for patient age, race, sex, insurance status, severity
              of illness, and specific medical comorbidities confirmed these
              differences. The differences between hospitalists and internists
              were most apparent among very ill patients. Mortality rates were
              similar (4.5\% for hospitalists versus 4.9\% for internists, P =

              versus 5.6\% for internists, P = 0.41). Patient satisfaction was
              similar for both groups. The internists used more resources in 8
              of 11 categories. CONCLUSIONS: The hospitalists provided
              cost-effective care, particularly for the sickest patients, with

              Flow Study); and (iii) to assess the correlation between staff
              perceptions and data from the Patient Flow Study. Methods: ED and
              non-ED staff were surveyed prior to the Patient Flow Study. The
              survey involved ranking the likely reasons for delay at three set
              points after triage (160, 320 and 480 min). Real-time data on
              delay in patients' journeys through the ED were collected over a
              period of 5 weeks. The correlation between staff perceptions and
              study data at the three time points was calculated using
              Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Subgroup analysis was
              performed on the basis of staff position, years of experience at
              St George and whether they had previously attended training on
              constraints to flow. Results: A total of 68 staff responded to
              the questionnaire (response rate 42\%). During the study period,
              4555 ED attendances (97\% of all presentations) were analysed for
              causes of constraint. Strong correlation between staff
              perceptions and real-time data was only found among some
              subgroups at the point 160 min from triage. Conclusions: Overall,
              staff perceptions regarding causes of constraint to patient flow

  author   = "Baldwin, David R",
  abstract = "Lung cancer incidence and mortality increase with all measures of
              socioeconomic deprivation primarily because of the fact that
              smoking rates also increase with the same measures. This powerful
              association means that we see double the number of people with
              lung cancer in the most deprived quintile compared with the least
              deprived. Socioeconomic deprivation is associated with reduced
              survival, more early deaths (within 30 or 90 days) and lower
              treatment rates.1--3 Possible explanations include a failure to
              present and seek help from doctors early and less effective
              primary healthcare in deprived communities, both factors
              postulated to result in delays in diagnosis and later stage at
              presentation. The systematic review and meta-analysis by Forrest
              et al 4 concludes that there is no association between
              socioeconomic position (SEP) and either stage at diagnosis or
              time intervals on the lung cancer pathway. More deprived patients
              were more likely to present as emergencies. The most important
              limitation, acknowledged by the authors, is the potential for
              masking of the effect of SEP on delays in the pathway by the
              `sicker quicker' effect. This refers to the finding that sicker
              patients progress more quickly through the pathway, thus
              potentially cancelling an effect of SEP on late presentation.
              This factor was not accounted for in the included studies. They
              also raise concerns about whether all studies that contain
              information about the factors studied have been included. Despite
              these important limitations, the authors say that the implication
              of their findings for policy is that early diagnosis campaigns do
              not need to be targeted to the more deprived and that these
              should be applied irrespective of SEP. Back-tracking somewhat,
              they also say it may be prudent to target the more deprived
              groups purely because of the increased incidence of lung cancer.
              So, do we target the more deprived or not? …",

                     of a SMA-actuated meso-scale robot for neurosurgery, which
                     can be operated under MRI guidance. In this robot, we use
                     two antagonistic SMA wires as actuators for each joint, so
                     that each joint can be actuated independently. Due to the
                     size scale of the robot, it is impossible to have
                     individual position sensors at each joint and hence we
                     rely primarily on temperature feedback to control the
                     robot. We thus designed and developed an experimental
                     setup to characterize the SMA wires. The goal of SMA
                     characterization was to develop systematic experiments
                     whereby the dependence of the joint motion on the
                     temperature (and hence the SMA phase transition) can be
                     experimentally determined. We also developed a theoretical
                     model based on Tanaka's model and the geometry of the
                     robot to characterize the joint motion with the change in
                     SMA wire temperature. The results demonstrated that the
                     SMA wire temperature can be used reliably to predict the
                     joint motion of the robot. We then developed a Pulse Width
                     Modulation (PWM) scheme to control the temperature of SMA
                     wires (and hence the joint motion). By using PWM control
                     and switching circuits, we can actuate multiple SMA wires
                     simultaneously and independently using only one power
                     supply. Experimental results from our current prototype of
                     a 2-DOF robot show that we can actuate the SMA wires

  abstract = "Background: While modern reconstructive surgery was
              revolutionized with the introduction of microsurgical techniques,
              microsurgery itself has seen the introduction of a range of
              technological aids and modern techniques aiming to improve
              dissection times, anastomotic times, and overall outcomes. These
              include improved preoperative planning, anastomotic aides, and
              earlier detection of complications with higher salvage rates.
              Despite the potential for substantial impact, many of these
              techniques have been evaluated in a limited fashion, and the
              evidence for each has not been universally explored. The purpose
              of this review was to establish and quantify the evidence for
              each technique. Methods: A search of relevant medical databases
              was performed to identify literature providing evidence for each
              technology. Levels of evidence were thus accumulated and applied
              to each technique. Results: There is a relative paucity of
              evidence for many of the more recent technologies described in
              the field of microsurgery, with no randomized controlled trials,
              and most studies in the field comprising case series only.
              Current evidence-based suggestions include the use of computed
              tomographic angiography (CTA) for the preoperative planning of
              perforator flaps, the intraoperative use of a mechanical
              anastomotic coupling aide (particularly the
              Unilink\textregistered{} coupler), and postoperative flap
              monitoring with strict protocols using clinical bedside
              monitoring and/or the implantable Doppler probe. Conclusion:
              Despite the breadth of technologies introduced into the field of
              microsurgery, there is substantial variation in the degree of
              evidence presented for each, suggesting the role for much future

              preferred method for obtaining bronchoscopic lung biopsy
              specimens. Cryoprobe biopsy (CBx) has been shown to obtain larger
              and higher quality samples, but is limited by its inability to
              retrieve the sample through the working channel of the
              bronchoscope, requiring the bronchoscope to leave the airway for
              sample retrieval. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated a novel device using a
              sheath cryobiopsy (SCBx). This method allows for specimen
              retrieval through the working channel of the bronchoscope, with
              the scope remaining inside the airway. METHODS: This prospective,
              randomized controlled, single-blinded porcine study compared a
              1.1-mm SCBx probe, a 1.9-mm CBx probe, and 2.0-mm FBx forceps.
              Assessment of histologic accessibility, sample quantity and
              quality, number of attempts to acquire and retrieve samples,
              cryoprobe activation time, fluoroscopy activation time, technical
              feasibility, and complications were compared. RESULTS: Samples
              adequate for standard pathologic processing were retrieved with
              82.1\% of the SCBx specimens, 82.9\%\% of the CBx specimens, and
              30\% of the FBx specimens. The histologic accessibility of both
              SCBx (P = .0002) and CBx (P = .0003) was superior to FBx.
              Procedure time for FBx was faster than for both SCBx and CBx, but
              SCBx was significantly faster than CBx (P < .0001). Fluoroscopy
              time was lower for both SCBx and CBx compared with FBx. There
              were no significant bleeding events. CONCLUSIONS: SCBx is a
              feasible technique providing a higher quality lung biopsy
              specimen compared with FBx and can successfully be retrieved
              through the working channel. Human studies are needed to further

              is of paramount importance before clinical introduction of
              transgastric natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery
              (NOTES). Gastrotomy closure in humans using standard endoclips
              has been reported. The aim of this study was to assess the safety
              of standard endoclip closure and to compare it to a new
              over-the-scope clip (OTSC) specifically designed for gastrotomy
              closure. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Gastric wall puncture and balloon
              dilation followed by peritoneoscopy was carried out in 20 female
              swine. After randomization, closure of the gastric incision was
              performed using a tissue approximation grasper and either
              endoclips or OTSCs. RESULTS: Mean (+/- SD) time for gastrotomy
              closure using endoclips was 31.5 +/- 24.2 minutes (range 8 - 88
              minutes) compared with 8.5 +/- 9.1 minutes (range 2 - 31 minutes)
              using OTSC (P = 0.002). No intraoperative complications occurred.
              Laparoscopic leak tests with insufflation and saline immersion
              demonstrated three minor leaks and one major leak in the endoclip
              closures. No leaks were observed in the OTSC group. At necropsy,
              complete sealing of the gastrotomy sites was found in all OTSC
              closures. Small, localized perigastric abscesses were observed in
              two animals in the OTSC group and in three animals in the
              endoclip group. One animal in the endoclip group was sacrificed
              prematurely due to signs of sepsis and was found to have gross
              peritonitis secondary to a leak. At necropsy, evidence of
              peritonitis was identified in two other animals in the endoclip
              group. CONCLUSION: NOTES gastrotomy closure using standard
              endoclips, even with a tissue approximation grasper, is
              associated with an increased risk of leakage and intra-abdominal
              infection compared with OTSC. The significance of perigastric
              abscesses, which were seen in both groups, warrants further
              investigation.",

              approach could overcome some of these limitations. An initial

              transanal access and total mesorectal excision, a specifically

              is tempered by the false positive rate and the need to perform
              diagnostic procedures to determine the aetiology of the solitary
              pulmonary nodules (SPN) identified. We have developed a novel
              procedure which allows sampling of SPNs via a transparenchymal
              approach, and report the results from this as a first in human
              trial. METHODS: This study was a prospective single-arm
              interventional study. We recruited patients with a SPN detected
              on CT imaging, which was suspicious for lung cancer, who were
              suitable for surgical resection. Using the subject's CT, an
              optimal airway wall point of entry (POE), and an avascular path
              through lung tissue from the POE to the SPN was calculated. A
              tunnel tract was created from the POE to the nodule using a set
              of catheter-based tools under fused fluoroscopy guidance. The
              patients proceeded to surgical resection immediately after the
              biopsy. The participants were followed-up for 6 months after the
              procedure. The primary endpoint of the study was to evaluate the
              feasibility to access and biopsy the nodule. RESULTS: Twelve
              patients were recruited, and a tunnel pathway created in 10
              patients. There were no adverse events during the procedures.
              Adequate biopsies were obtained from 10 patients (83\%), which
              correlated with the histological findings from the surgical
              resection. Inspection of the resected lobes did not raise any
              safety concerns and indicated appropriately tunnelled pathways to
              the nodule. CONCLUSIONS: This first in human study demonstrates
              that bronchoscopic transparenchymal access of SPNs is feasible.

              in some form for over 2 decades, claiming to improve total joint
              arthroplasty by enhancing the surgeon's ability to reproduce
              alignment and therefore better restore normal kinematics. Various
              current systems include a robotic arm, robotic-guided cutting
              jigs, and robotic milling systems with a diversity of different
              navigation strategies using active, semiactive, or passive
              control systems. Semiactive systems have become dominant,
              providing a haptic window through which the surgeon is able to
              consistently prepare an arthroplasty based on preoperative
              planning. A review of previous designs and clinical studies
              demonstrate that these robotic systems decrease variability and
              increase precision, primarily focusing on component positioning
              and alignment. Some early clinical results indicate decreased
              revision rates and improved patient satisfaction with

              Transbronchial cryobiopsy via flexible bronchoscope may this for
              more patients. The relative costs, diagnostic yields and safety
              of this approach and more traditional approaches have not been
              determined. Objectives: To perform a systematic review and
              meta-analysis of transbronchial cryobiopsy, forceps
              transbronchial biopsy and video assisted (VATS) surgical lung
              biopsy assessing their relative diagnostic yields and safety. To
              perform a cost analysis to demonstrate any savings through change
              to the newer technique. Methods: We performed a systematic review
              of the literature using MEDLINE and EMBASE for all original
              articles on the diagnostic yield and safety of transbronchial
              cryobiopsy, forceps transbronchial biopsy and VATS-biopsy in ILD
              up to February 2016. Data were extracted on yield and
              complication rates, in addition to study characteristics.
              Theoretical cost analysis was performed from local institution
              financial data, 2015-16 reimbursement tariffs and results of the
              systematic review. Results: A meta-analysis of 11 investigations
              for transbronchial cryobiopsy, 11 for forceps transbronchial
              biopsy and 24 for VATS-biopsy revealed diagnostic yields of
              84.4\% (75.9-91.4\%), 64.3\% (52.6-75.1\%) and 91.1\%
              (84.9-95.7\%), respectively. Pneumothorax occurred in 10\%
              (5.4-16.1\%) of transbronchial cryobiopsy procedures, moderate
              bleeding in 20.99\% (5.6-42.8\%), with three deaths reported.
              Surgical mortality was 2.3\% (1.3-3.6\%). Cost analysis
              demonstrated potential savings of \pounds{}210 per patient in the
              first year and \pounds{}647 in subsequent years. Conclusions:
              Transbronchial cryobiopsy represents a potentially cost-saving
              approach to improve histological diagnosis in ILD, however is
              accompanied by a significant risk of moderate bleeding.",

              secretions, and foreign bodies is a potentially life-threatening
              condition. Optimal management of this problem, whether by rigid
              or flexible bronchoscopy, has not been well studied. We report
              our single-center experience on the safety and clinical utility
              of cryoprobe extraction for this indication. METHODS: We
              performed a retrospective chart review from January 2006 to
              November 2014 of all subjects aged 18 and older who underwent
              flexible bronchoscopic cryoprobe extraction. Subjects with
              obstruction due to benign or malignant neoplasm or airway
              stenosis were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 38 cryotherapy
              sessions performed on 30 subjects were identified for inclusion.
              Cryoprobe extraction was successful in reestablishing airway
              patency in 32/38 (84\%) sessions overall and in 24/26 (92\%) for
              blood clots, 4/6 (67\%) for mucous plugging, 2/4 (50\%) for
              foreign bodies, and 2/2 (100\%) for plastic bronchitis.
              Twenty-one of 31 (68\%) sessions resulted in improvement in
              oxygenation or ventilation. There was 1 complication related to
              sedation. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that flexible bronchoscopic
              cryoprobe extraction of blood clots, mucous secretions, plastic
              bronchitis, and foreign bodies is a safe and effective option. It
              can be safely performed at the bedside and in many cases
              eliminates the need for rigid bronchoscopy.",

              utilization of minimally invasive surgery for four common
              surgical procedures (appendectomy, colectomy, total abdominal

              Retrospective review. SETTING: United States. PARTICIPANTS:
              Nationwide inpatient sample database, United States 2010.
              METHODS: For each procedure, a propensity score model was used to
              calculate the predicted proportion of minimally invasive
              operations for each hospital based on patient characteristics.
              For each procedure, hospitals were categorized into thirds (low,
              medium, and high) based on their actual to predicted proportion
              of utilization of minimally invasive surgery. MAIN OUTCOME
              MEASURES: The primary outcome measures were the actual and
              predicted proportion of procedures performed with minimally
              invasive surgery. Secondary outcome measures included surgical
              complications and hospital characteristics. RESULTS: Mean
              hospital utilization of minimally invasive surgery was 71.0\%
              (423/596) for appendectomy (range 40.9-93.1\% (244-555)), 28.4\%
              (154/541) for colectomy (6.7-49.8\% (36/541-269/541)), 13.0\%
              (65/499) for hysterectomy (0.0-33.6\% (0/499-168/499)), and
              32.0\% (67/208) for lung lobectomy (3.6-65.7\%
              (7.5/208-137/208)). Utilization of minimally invasive surgery was
              highly variable for each procedure type. There was noticeable
              discordance between actual and predicted utilization of the
              surgery (range of actual to predicted ratio for appendectomy
              0-1.49; colectomy 0-3.88; hysterectomy 0-6.68; lung lobectomy
              0-2.51). Surgical complications were less common with minimally
              invasive surgery compared with open surgery, respectively:
              overall rate for appendectomy 3.94\% (1439/36,513) v 7.90\%
              (958/12,123), P<0.001; for colectomy: 13.8\% (1689/12,242) v
              35.8\% (8837/24,687), P<0.001; for hysterectomy: 4.69\%
              (270/5757) v 6.64\% (1988/29,940), P<0.001; and for lung
              lobectomy: 17.1\% (367/2145) v 25.4\% (971/3824), P<0.05. High
              utilization of minimally invasive surgery was associated with
              urban location (appendectomy: odds ratio 4.66, 95\% confidence
              interval 1.17 to 18.5; colectomy: 4.59, 1.04 to 20.3;
              hysterectomy: 15.0, 2.98 to 75.0), large hospital size
              (hysterectomy: 8.70, 1.62 to 46.8), teaching hospital
              (hysterectomy: 5.41, 1.27 to 23.1), Midwest region (appendectomy:

              substantial burden on patients, health care systems and society
              due to increasing incidence and poor survival rates. In recent
              years, advances in the treatment of metastatic NSCLC have
              resulted from the introduction of targeted therapies. However,
              the application of these new agents increases treatment costs
              considerably. The objective of this article is to review the
              economic evidence of targeted therapies in metastatic NSCLC.
              METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify
              cost-effectiveness (CE) as well as cost-utility studies. Medline,
              Embase, SciSearch, Cochrane, and 9 other databases were searched
              from 2000 through April 2013 (including update) for full-text
              publications. The quality of the studies was assessed via the
              validated Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) instrument.
              RESULTS: Nineteen studies (including update) involving the MoAb
              bevacizumab and the Tyrosine-kinase inhibitors erlotinib and
              gefitinib met all inclusion criteria. The majority of studies
              analyzed the CE of first-line maintenance and second-line
              treatment with erlotinib. Five studies dealt with bevacizumab in
              first-line regimes. Gefitinib and pharmacogenomic profiling were
              each covered by only two studies. Furthermore, the available
              evidence was of only fair quality. CONCLUSION: First-line
              maintenance treatment with erlotinib compared to Best Supportive
              Care (BSC) can be considered cost-effective. In comparison to
              docetaxel, erlotinib is likely to be cost-effective in subsequent
              treatment regimens as well. The insights for bevacizumab are
              miscellaneous. There are findings that gefitinib is
              cost-effective in first- and second-line treatment, however,
              based on only two studies. The role of pharmacogenomic testing
              needs to be evaluated. Therefore, future research should improve
              the available evidence and consider pharmacogenomic profiling as
              specified by the European Medicines Agency. Upcoming agents like
              crizotinib and afatinib need to be analyzed as well.",

              OBJECTIVE: To create an overview and categorize assistive devices
              facilitating arm function in activities of daily living for
              people with decreased arm function. STUDY DESIGN: Literature
              review. METHODS: A systematic review in three scientific
              literature databases. Conference proceedings, assistive
              technology databases, and references were searched and experts
              consulted. This resulted in a database of dynamic arm supports.
              Product information was added, and the devices were categorized.
              RESULTS: A total of 104 dynamic arm supports were found. These
              could be categorized as nonactuated devices (N = 39), passively
              actuated devices (N = 24), actively actuated devices (N = 34), or
              devices using the functional electrical stimulation principle (N
              = 7). Functionality analysis resulted in second-level
              categorization: tremor suppression, facilitation of anti-gravity
              movement, and assistance of specific joint motion. CONCLUSION:
              All devices could be ordered in a categorization of low
              complexity. Many have been developed; most have disappeared and
              have been succeeded by similar devices. Limitations of the

              laparoscopic surgery-based policy with a continued medical
              management policy. Cost-effectiveness was assessed alongside the
              trial using a NHS perspective for costs and expressing health
              outcomes in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).
              SETTING: Follow-up was by annual postal questionnaire and
              selective hospital case notes review; initial recruitment in 21
              UK hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Questionnaire responders among the
              810 original participants. At entry, all had documented evidence
              of GORD and symptoms for > 12 months. Questionnaire response
              rates (years 1-5) were from 89.5\% to 68.9\%. INTERVENTIONS:
              Three hundred and fifty-seven participants were recruited to the
              randomised comparison (178 randomised to surgical management and
              179 randomised to continued medical management) and 453 to the
              preference groups (261 surgical management and 192 medical
              management). The surgeon chose the type of fundoplication. MAIN
              OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary: disease-specific outcome measure (the
              REFLUX questionnaire); secondary: Short Form questionnaire-36
              items (SF-36), European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), NHS
              resource use, reflux medication, complications. RESULTS: The
              randomised groups were well balanced. By 5 years, 63\% in the
              randomised surgical group and 13\% in the randomised medical
              management group had received a total or partial wrap
              fundoplication (85\% and 3\% in the preference groups), with few
              perioperative complications and no associated deaths. At 1 year
              (and 5 years) after surgery, 36\% (41\%) in the randomised
              surgical group - 15\% (26\%) of those who had surgery - were
              taking proton pump inhibitor medication compared with 87\% (82\%)
              in the randomised medical group. At each year, differences in the
              REFLUX score significantly favoured the randomised surgical group
              (a third of a SD; p 0.80 for all analyses. CONCLUSIONS: After 5
              years, laparoscopic fundoplication continues to provide better
              relief of GORD symptoms with associated improved health-related
              quality of life. Complications of surgery were uncommon. Despite
              being initially more costly, a surgical policy is highly likely
              to be cost-effective. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled
