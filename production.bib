              to the cytoplasm is called cytoplasmic polyadenylation. It was
              first discovered in oocytes and embryos, where it has roles in
              meiosis and development. In recent years, however, has been
              implicated in many other processes, including synaptic plasticity
              and mitosis. This review aims to introduce cytoplasmic
              polyadenylation with an emphasis on the factors and elements
              mediating this process for different mRNAs and in different
              animal species. We will discuss the RNA sequence elements
              mediating cytoplasmic polyadenylation in the 3' untranslated
              regions of mRNAs, including the CPE, MBE, TCS, eCPE, and C-CPE.
              In addition to describing the role of general polyadenylation
              factors, we discuss the specific RNA binding protein families
              associated with cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements, including
              CPEB (CPEB1, CPEB2, CPEB3, and CPEB4), Pumilio (PUM2), Musashi
              (MSI1, MSI2), zygote arrest (ZAR2), ELAV like proteins (ELAVL1,
              HuR), poly(C) binding proteins (PCBP2, $\alpha$CP2, hnRNP-E2),
              and Bicaudal C (BICC1). Some emerging themes in cytoplasmic
              polyadenylation will be highlighted. To facilitate understanding
              for those working in different organisms and fields, particularly
              those who are analyzing high throughput data, HUGO gene

              4 Gy. Abundant $\gamma$H2AX foci were observed at 4 Gy after 4 h
              of culture post-irradiation. Sham-irradiated cells showed no
              $\gamma$H2AX foci and therefore no signs of radiation-induced
              double-strand DNA breaks. Flow cytometry indicated that 41.5\% of
              HepG2 cells were in G2/M and this rose statistically
              significantly with increasing radiation dose reaching a plateau
              at ∼47\%. Cell lysates from both cell lines were subjected to
              metabolomic analysis using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry
              (GCMS). A total of 46 metabolites could be identified by GCMS in
              HepG2 cell lysates and 29 in HMCL-7304 lysates, most of which
              occurred in HepG2 cells. Principal Components Analysis (PCA)
              showed a clear separation of sham, 1, 2 and 4 Gy doses.
              Orthogonal Projection to Latent Structures-Discriminant Analysis
              (OPLS-DA) revealed elevations in intracellular lactate, alanine,
              glucose, glucose 6-phosphate, fructose and 5-oxoproline, which
              were found by univariate statistics to be highly statistically
              significantly elevated at both 2 and 4 Gy compared with sham
              irradiated cells. These findings suggested upregulation of
              cytosolic aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect), with potential
              shunting of glucose through aldose reductase in the polyol
              pathway, and consumption of reduced Glutathione (GSH) due to
              $\gamma$-irradiation. In HMCL-7304 myotubes, a putative Warburg
              effect was also observed only at 2 Gy, albeit a lesser magnitude
              than in HepG2 cells. It is anticipated that these novel metabolic
              perturbations following $\gamma$-irradiation of cultured cells

              mRNA polyadenylation isoform choice. 3' untranslated regions
              regulate mRNA fate, and their choice is tightly controlled during

              isoforms. Notably this variation exceeds random selection with
              equal preference in all cells, a finding that was confirmed by

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Spastic cerebral palsy (CP) is a leading cause of
              physical disability. Most people with spastic CP are born with
              it, but early diagnosis is challenging, and no current biomarker
              platform readily identifies affected individuals. The aim of this
              study was to evaluate epigenetic profiles as biomarkers for
              spastic CP. A novel analysis pipeline was employed to assess DNA
              methylation patterns between peripheral blood cells of adolescent
              subjects (14.9 $\pm$ 0.3 years old) with spastic CP and controls
              at single CpG site resolution. RESULTS: Significantly hypo- and
              hyper-methylated CpG sites associated with spastic CP were
              identified. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling fully
              discriminated the CP group from the controls. Machine learning
              based classification modeling indicated a high potential for a
              diagnostic model, and 252 sets of 40 or fewer CpG sites achieved
              near-perfect accuracy within our adolescent cohorts. A pilot test
              on significantly younger subjects (4.0 $\pm$ 1.5 years old)
              identified subjects with 73\% accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent
              patients with spastic CP can be distinguished from a non-CP
              cohort based on DNA methylation patterns in peripheral blood
              cells. A clinical diagnostic test utilizing a panel of CpG sites
              may be possible using a simulated classification model. A pilot
              validation test on patients that were more than 10 years younger
              than the main adolescent cohorts indicated that distinguishing
              methylation patterns are present earlier in life. This study is
              the first to report an epigenetic assay capable of distinguishing
              a CP cohort.",

  abstract = "Switching between different alternative polyadenylation (APA)
              sites plays an important role in the fine tuning of gene
              expression. New technologies for the execution of 3'-end enriched
              RNA-seq allow genome-wide detection of the genes that exhibit
              significant APA site switching between different samples. Here,
              we show that the independence test gives better results than the
              linear trend test in detecting APA site-switching events. Further
              examination suggests that the discrepancy between these two
              statistical methods arises from complex APA site-switching events
              that cannot be represented by a simple change of average 3'-UTR
              length. In theory, the linear trend test is only effective in
              detecting these simple changes. We classify the switching events
              into four switching patterns: two simple patterns (3'-UTR
              shortening and lengthening) and two complex patterns. By
              comparing the results of the two statistical methods, we show
              that complex patterns account for 1/4 of all observed switching
              events that happen between normal and cancerous human breast cell
              lines. Because simple and complex switching patterns may convey
              different biological meanings, they merit separate study. We
              therefore propose to combine both the independence test and the
              linear trend test in practice. First, the independence test
              should be used to detect APA site switching; second, the linear
              trend test should be invoked to identify simple switching events;
              and third, those complex switching events that pass independence
              testing but fail linear trend testing can be identified.",

              endonucleolytic cleavage, followed by the addition of a poly(A)
              tail. Through alternative polyadenylation, a gene can give rise
              to multiple mRNA isoforms that differ in the length of their 3'
              UTRs and hence in their susceptibility to post-transcriptional
              regulatory factors such as microRNAs. A series of recently
              conducted high-throughput studies of poly(A) site usage revealed
