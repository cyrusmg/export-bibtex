              to the cytoplasm is called cytoplasmic polyadenylation. It was
              first discovered in oocytes and embryos, where it has roles in
              meiosis and development. In recent years, however, has been
              implicated in many other processes, including synaptic plasticity
              and mitosis. This review aims to introduce cytoplasmic
              polyadenylation with an emphasis on the factors and elements
              mediating this process for different mRNAs and in different
              animal species. We will discuss the RNA sequence elements
              mediating cytoplasmic polyadenylation in the 3' untranslated
              regions of mRNAs, including the CPE, MBE, TCS, eCPE, and C-CPE.
              In addition to describing the role of general polyadenylation
              factors, we discuss the specific RNA binding protein families
              associated with cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements, including
              CPEB (CPEB1, CPEB2, CPEB3, and CPEB4), Pumilio (PUM2), Musashi
              (MSI1, MSI2), zygote arrest (ZAR2), ELAV like proteins (ELAVL1,
              HuR), poly(C) binding proteins (PCBP2, $\alpha$CP2, hnRNP-E2),
              and Bicaudal C (BICC1). Some emerging themes in cytoplasmic
              polyadenylation will be highlighted. To facilitate understanding

              of culture post-irradiation. Sham-irradiated cells showed no
              $\gamma$H2AX foci and therefore no signs of radiation-induced
              double-strand DNA breaks. Flow cytometry indicated that 41.5\% of
              HepG2 cells were in G2/M and this rose statistically
              significantly with increasing radiation dose reaching a plateau
              at ∼47\%. Cell lysates from both cell lines were subjected to
              metabolomic analysis using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry
              (GCMS). A total of 46 metabolites could be identified by GCMS in
              HepG2 cell lysates and 29 in HMCL-7304 lysates, most of which
              occurred in HepG2 cells. Principal Components Analysis (PCA)
              showed a clear separation of sham, 1, 2 and 4 Gy doses.
              Orthogonal Projection to Latent Structures-Discriminant Analysis

              shunting of glucose through aldose reductase in the polyol
              pathway, and consumption of reduced Glutathione (GSH) due to

              effect was also observed only at 2 Gy, albeit a lesser magnitude
              than in HepG2 cells. It is anticipated that these novel metabolic

              mRNA polyadenylation isoform choice. 3' untranslated regions
              regulate mRNA fate, and their choice is tightly controlled during

              physical disability. Most people with spastic CP are born with
              it, but early diagnosis is challenging, and no current biomarker
              platform readily identifies affected individuals. The aim of this
              study was to evaluate epigenetic profiles as biomarkers for
              spastic CP. A novel analysis pipeline was employed to assess DNA
              methylation patterns between peripheral blood cells of adolescent
              subjects (14.9 $\pm$ 0.3 years old) with spastic CP and controls
              at single CpG site resolution. RESULTS: Significantly hypo- and
              hyper-methylated CpG sites associated with spastic CP were
              identified. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling fully
              discriminated the CP group from the controls. Machine learning
              based classification modeling indicated a high potential for a
              diagnostic model, and 252 sets of 40 or fewer CpG sites achieved
              near-perfect accuracy within our adolescent cohorts. A pilot test
              on significantly younger subjects (4.0 $\pm$ 1.5 years old)
              identified subjects with 73\% accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent
              patients with spastic CP can be distinguished from a non-CP
              cohort based on DNA methylation patterns in peripheral blood
              cells. A clinical diagnostic test utilizing a panel of CpG sites
              may be possible using a simulated classification model. A pilot
              validation test on patients that were more than 10 years younger
              than the main adolescent cohorts indicated that distinguishing
              methylation patterns are present earlier in life. This study is

              sites plays an important role in the fine tuning of gene
              expression. New technologies for the execution of 3'-end enriched
              RNA-seq allow genome-wide detection of the genes that exhibit
              significant APA site switching between different samples. Here,
              we show that the independence test gives better results than the
              linear trend test in detecting APA site-switching events. Further
              examination suggests that the discrepancy between these two
              statistical methods arises from complex APA site-switching events
              that cannot be represented by a simple change of average 3'-UTR
              length. In theory, the linear trend test is only effective in
              detecting these simple changes. We classify the switching events
              into four switching patterns: two simple patterns (3'-UTR
              shortening and lengthening) and two complex patterns. By
              comparing the results of the two statistical methods, we show
              that complex patterns account for 1/4 of all observed switching
              events that happen between normal and cancerous human breast cell
              lines. Because simple and complex switching patterns may convey
              different biological meanings, they merit separate study. We
              therefore propose to combine both the independence test and the
              linear trend test in practice. First, the independence test
              should be used to detect APA site switching; second, the linear
              trend test should be invoked to identify simple switching events;
              and third, those complex switching events that pass independence
              testing but fail linear trend testing can be identified.",

              endonucleolytic cleavage, followed by the addition of a poly(A)
              tail. Through alternative polyadenylation, a gene can give rise

              UTRs and hence in their susceptibility to post-transcriptional
              regulatory factors such as microRNAs. A series of recently
              conducted high-throughput studies of poly(A) site usage revealed

              mutations in the bcl-2 gene show that the anti-proliferative
              activity of Bcl-2, can in some cases, be dissociated from its
              anti-apoptotic function. This indicates that the effect of Bcl-2
              on cell cycle progression can be a direct effect and not only a
              consequence of its anti-apoptotic activity. Bcl-2 appears to
              mediate its anti-proliferative effect by acting on both signal
              transduction pathways (NFAT, ERK) and on specific cell cycle
              regulators (p27, p130).",

              formed on the negative electrode of Li-ion batteries as a result

              Battery performance, irreversible charge ``loss'', rate
              capability, cyclability, exfoliation of graphite and safety are
              highly dependent on the quality of the SEI. Therefore,
              understanding the actual nature and composition of SEI is of
              prime interest. If the chemistry of the SEI formation and the
              manner in which each component affects battery performance are
              understood, SEI could be tuned to improve battery performance. In
              this paper key points related to the nature, formation, and
              features of the SEI formed on carbon negative electrodes are
              discussed. SEI has been analyzed by various analytical techniques
              amongst which FTIR and XPS are most widely used. FTIR and XPS
              data of SEI and its components as published by many research
              groups are compiled in tables for getting a global picture of
              what is known about the SEI. This article shall serve as a handy

  author   = "Faija, Cintia L and Fox, John R E and Tierney, Stephanie and
              Peters, Sarah and Gooding, Patricia A",
  abstract = "There is a growing body of theoretical and clinical literature
              highlighting the role of pride in maintaining eating disordered
              behaviours. Despite its clinical importance, there are no
              measures to assess feelings of pride associated with eating
              psychopathology. This study describes the development and
              validation of the Pride in Eating Pathology Scale (PEP-S), a
              self-report questionnaire that examines feelings of pride towards
              eating disordered symptoms (e.g., pride in food restriction,
              thinness and weight loss). Participants were 390 females,
              recruited from university and community populations, whose mean
              age was 26.99 years. Respondents rated pride in eating pathology
              on a 7-point Likert-scale. Principal Component Analysis indicated
              that the 60-item scale comprised a four component structure: (1)
              pride in weight loss, food control and thinness, (2) pride in
              healthy weight and healthy eating, (3) pride in outperforming
              others and social recognition and (4) pride in capturing other
              people's attention due to extreme thinness. These four components
              explained a total of 65.31\% of the variance. The PEP-S
              demonstrated very good internal reliability ($\alpha$ ranging
              from 0.88 to 0.98) and very good test-retest reliability over a
              3-week time-span (r ranging from 0.81 to 0.93). The PEP-S also
              showed excellent convergent and discriminant validity.
              Furthermore, the scale discriminated between women with high and
              low levels of eating psychopathology. The PEP-S is a
              psychometrically robust measure of pride in eating pathology. It
              has the potential to advance theoretical understanding and may
              also be clinically useful. Copyright \copyright{} 2015 John Wiley
              \& Sons, Ltd. KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGE: The PEP-S is a valid,
              reliable, quick and easy to administer self-report questionnaire
              that measures pride related to eating pathology. The PEP-S
              assesses four clinically relevant dimensions: (1) pride in weight
              loss, food control and thinness, (2) pride in healthy weight and
              healthy eating, (3) pride in outperforming others and social
              recognition and (4) pride in capturing other people's attention
              due to extreme thinness. The PEP-S has very good internal and
              test-retest reliability, and very good convergent and
              discriminant validity. The PEP-S distinguishes between women with
              higher and lower levels of eating psychopathology. The PEP-S
              makes an important contribution to understanding pride in eating
              psychopathology, which is essential from both clinical and
              theoretical perspectives.",

              measurement has traditionally focused on symptom reduction rather
              than functioning or quality of life (QoL). Generic QoL measures
              lack sensitivity for some diagnoses and many not be responsive in
              eating disorder patients. This article describes the development
              and validation of a condition-specific QoL measure for
              adolescents and adults with eating disorders--the Eating
              Disorders Quality of Life Scale (EDQLS). METHODS: Multi-source
              and multi-stage methods were used to develop the EDQLS, with
              participation of patients with EDs, their family members and ED
              treatment providers. Sources for domain and item development
              included 39 articles, 12 patient and 10 treatment provider
              interviews, and 31 first person narratives from the internet.
              Four stages of validation and pre-testing involving 17 patients,
              10 family members and 18 providers reduced 233 items to 40 items
              in 12 domains. These items were pilot tested in 41 ED patients.
              RESULTS: The final instrument was then validated in a 12 site
              sample of 171 individuals aged 14-60 with EDs. All items showed
              good dispersion. The total raw mean score was 110 out of 200 (SD
              27.6) with higher scores indicating better QoL. Internal
              consistency was excellent (Cronbach's alpha = .96) and subscale
              internal consistency ranged from alpha .36 to .79 providing
              evidence for a strong overall construct and some
              multi-dimensionality. Validity was supported by significant
              differences in mean EDQLS according to severity levels on the
              EDI-2 (F = 95.3, p <.001) and the BSI (F = 86.9, p <.001). EDQLS
              scores were positively associated with time in treatment (F =
              4.65, p = .01) suggesting responsiveness. A strong positive
              association was also found between EDQLS scores and stage of
              change (F = 15.1 p <.001). Pearson's correlations between the
              EDQLS and criterion instrument scores were .71 for the SF-12
              mental subscale, .61 for the QoLI and .78 for the 16D, supporting
              construct validity. Exploratory principal components and item
              response theory analyses identified only a few poor fitting
              items. CONCLUSION: The EDQLS has promising psychometric

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening
              syndrome that is precipitated by the use of serotonergic drugs
              and overactivation of both the peripheral and central
              postsynaptic 5HT-1A and, most notably, 5HT-2A receptors. This
              syndrome consists of a combination of mental status changes,
              neuromuscular hyperactivity, and autonomic hyperactivity.
              Serotonin syndrome can occur via the therapeutic use of
              serotonergic drugs alone, an intentional overdose of serotonergic
              drugs, or classically, as a result of a complex drug interaction
              between two serotonergic drugs that work by different mechanisms.
              A multitude of drug combinations can result in serotonin
              syndrome. METHODS: This review describes the presentation and
              management of serotonin syndrome and discusses the drugs and
              interactions that can precipitate this syndrome with the goal of
              making physicians more alert and aware of this potentially fatal
              yet preventable syndrome. CONCLUSION: Many commonly used
              medications have proven to be the culprits of serotonin syndrome.

              the HIS questionnaire. DESIGN: As no similar tool exists, we
              compared the HIS with three tools that reflect its key areas:
              physical impact (Pregnancy Unique Quantification of Emesis--PUQE
              score and markers of severity of HG), psychological impact
              (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score--HADS) and social impact

              women and children's hospital in the North West of England.
              PARTICIPANTS: The HIS was evaluated on 50 women admitted to
              hospital with HG and 50 women recruited from ante-natal clinic
              without severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and with an
              uncomplicated pregnancy. RESULTS: Good criterion validity was
              demonstrated by strong significant correlations with all three

               double-masked, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trials
               conducted in private-practice psychiatric outpatient clinics.
               Following a 1-week, single-masked, placebo lead-in period,
               patients received bupropion SR for 8 weeks (study 1: 150 or 300

               events, patient discontinuation rates, changes in weight, vital
               signs, and clinical laboratory test results. Across studies, the
               most frequently reported adverse events were headache, dry

  abstract  = "A substantial body of evidence provides support (but not
               definitive proof of efficacy) for the use of antiretroviral
               agents as postexposure prophylaxis for occupational exposures to
               HIV in the healthcare workplace. Despite the lack of definitive
               evidence of the efficacy of these agents in this setting, over
               the past decade this intervention has become the standard of
               care for healthcare workers who sustain occupational exposures
               to HIV. Administration of these agents--even for a relatively
               short 28-day postexposure course--is often fraught with
               difficulty. All of the agents currently used for postexposure
               prophylaxis regimens have substantial adverse effects, and
               significant adverse effects occur in more than two-thirds of
               individuals electing prophylaxis. This manuscript reiterates
               current US Federal Government guidelines for the administration
               of postexposure prophylaxis, specifically noting that zidovudine
               plus lamivudine (with or without a protease inhibitor) remains
               the recommended regimen. The paper summarises the significant
               toxicities associated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase
               inhibitors (primarily nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and bone
               marrow suppression), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase
               inhibitors (rash, fever, gastrointestinal symptoms and
               hepatitis, including hepatic decompensation necessitating liver
               transplantation) and protease inhibitors (nausea, vomiting,
               diarrhoea, abdominal pain, hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia,
               headache and anorexia). As a class, the antiretroviral agents
               have an extraordinary number of drug interactions. The
               non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and the protease
               inhibitors are metabolised through the cytochrome P450 pathway,
               and the effects of concomitant administration of protease
               inhibitors with other agents in the same class are discussed, as
               well as the effects of concomitant administration of protease
               inhibitors with non-nucleoside agents. The potential for
               numerous and medically risky drug interactions emphasises the
               importance of planning antiretroviral prophylaxis in
               consultation with practitioners or clinical pharmacists who are
               skilled in the use of these agents and knowledgeable about the
               potential for significant drug interactions that could either
               reduce the benefit of prophylaxis or increase the potential for
               toxicity. Another common problem encountered by individuals
               managing postexposure prophylaxis programmes relates to the
               administration of chemoprophylaxis to a pregnant healthcare
               worker who has sustained an occupational exposure to HIV. We
               address what is known about the potential for toxicity and
               emphasise the recently published warning concerning the deaths
               of pregnant women and their offspring from lactic acidosis while
               receiving regimens containing stavudine and didanosine.",

              topiramate's efficacy in migraine prevention. OBJECTIVE: To
              assess the efficacy and safety of topiramate as a
              migraine-preventive therapy. DESIGN: A 26-week, randomized,
              double-blind, placebo-controlled study. SETTING: Outpatient
              treatment at 49 US clinical centers. Patients Patients were aged
              12 to 65 years, had a 6-month International Headache Society
              migraine history, and experienced 3 to 12 migraines per month,
              but had 15 or fewer headache days per month during the 28-day
              baseline period. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to
              placebo or topiramate, 50, 100, or 200 mg/d, titrated by 25 mg/wk
              to the assigned dose or as tolerated in 8 weeks; maintenance
              therapy continued for 18 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The
              primary efficacy assessment was a reduction in mean monthly
              migraine frequency across the 6-month treatment phase. Secondary
              end points were responder rate, time to onset of action, mean
              change in migraine days per month, and mean change in rescue
              medication days per month. RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-seven
              patients were randomized, and 469 composed the intent-to-treat
              population. The mean +/- SD monthly migraine frequency decreased
              significantly for the 100-mg/d group (from 5.4 +/- 2.2 to 3.3 +/-
              2.9; P <.001) and the 200-mg/d group (from 5.6 +/- 2.6 to 3.3 +/-
              2.9; P <.001) vs the placebo group (from 5.6 +/- 2.3 to 4.6 +/-
              3.0); improvements occurred within the first treatment month.
              Significantly more topiramate-treated patients (50 mg/d, 35.9\%
              [P =.04]; 100 mg/d, 54.0\% [P <.001]; and 200 mg/d, 52.3\% [P
              <.001]) exhibited a 50\% or more reduction in monthly migraine
              frequency than placebo-treated patients (22.6\%). Adverse events
              included paresthesia, fatigue, nausea, anorexia, and taste per

              capsule formulation of Adderall designed to produce a therapeutic
              effect that lasts throughout the day with 1 morning dose. The
              primary objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and
              safety of SLI381 compared with placebo in the treatment of
              attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children in a

              to assess the diurnal variation in responses based on morning and
              afternoon assessments. METHODS: A multicenter, randomized,
              double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial was
              conducted at 47 sites. After a 1-week washout of any previous
              stimulant medication, patients were randomized to receive
              single-daily morning doses of placebo or SLI381 10 mg, 20 mg, or
              30 mg for 3 weeks. Participants aged 6 to 12 years inclusive who
              satisfied Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
              Fourth Edition criteria diagnosis of ADHD were included. The
              primary efficacy parameter was the Conners Global Index Scale for
              Teachers. Secondary efficacy parameters included the Conners
              Global Index Scale for Parents, the Clinical Global Impressions
              Scale for improvement, and the Parent Global Assessment for
              improvement. Safety was assessed by recording adverse events,
              laboratory tests, and vital signs at each visit during the study.
              Physical examinations and electrocardiograms were performed at
              the screening and the end of the study. RESULTS: Five hundred
              eighty-four children were randomized, 563 were included in the
              intent-to-treat population, and 509 completed the entire study.
              Intention-to-treat analysis of Conners Global Index Scale for
              Teachers and Conners Global Index Scale for Parents scores
              revealed significant improvement in morning, afternoon, and late
              afternoon behavior for all active treatment groups versus
              placebo. All active treatment groups showed significant
              dose-related improvement in behavior from baseline. Both the
              Clinical Global Impressions Scale for improvement and Parent
              Global Assessment for improvement showed all doses of SLI381 to
              be superior to placebo at treatment end and both confirmed the
              dose-response relationship between improvement and the SLI381
              dose. The incidence of spontaneously reported adverse events was
              low and similar for active treatments and placebo. CONCLUSIONS:
              SLI381 produced consistent, dose-related improvements on all
              measures of efficacy. The extended-release nature of the SLI381
              formulation was shown by continued, significant improvement in
              afternoon assessments by teachers and afternoon and late
              afternoon assessments by parents. The time course and therapeutic
              effects of SLI381 suggests that this medication is an efficacious
              once-daily treatment for children with ADHD.",

              clinical trials of fluoxetine reinforced this agent's more
              favorable adverse-event profile compared with tricyclic
              antidepressants (TCAs). OBJECTIVES: The present meta-analysis
              sought to provide a reanalysis of updated adverse-event and
              discontinuation data for fluoxetine 20 to 80 mg/d compared with
              TCAs and placebo in the treatment of major depressive disorder
              (MDD) in adults. A subanalysis to assess the safety profile of
              the most commonly used effective dose of fluoxetine in MDD (20
              mg) was also conducted. METHODS: Data were obtained from 25
              double-blind clinical trials involving 4016 patients with MDD
              randomized to treatment with fluoxetine 20 to 80 mg/d, TCAs, or
              placebo. The subanalysis included data from 6 trials involving
              1258 patients treated with fixed 20-mg doses of fluoxetine or
              placebo. Spontaneously reported treatment-emergent adverse
              events, reasons for discontinuation, and events leading to
              discontinuation were compared between groups. RESULTS: The age of
              the 4016 randomized patients ranged from 12 to 90 years, with a
              mean age of 46 years. Most patients were white (92\%), and 62\%
              were female. The age of the 1258 patients in the 20-mg fixed-dose
              population ranged from 18 to 90 years, with a mean age of 54
              years; as in the total population, most of these patients were
              white (92\%), and 57\% were female. The adverse-event profiles of
              fluoxetine and TCAs in these trials were consistent with the
              typical profiles of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and
              TCAs. At a dose of 20 mg/d, fluoxetine-treated patients had a
              discontinuation rate due to adverse events that was not
              statistically significantly different from that in placebo
              recipients. Discontinuation rates due to lack of efficacy were
              not significantly different between fluoxetine and TCAs. However,
              significantly more TCA-treated patients discontinued therapy
              because of adverse events and significantly fewer completed
              treatment compared with fluoxetine-treated patients (both, P or =
              2\%) leading to discontinuation were asthenia, dizziness,
              insomnia, nausea, nervousness, somnolence, and tremor in
              fluoxetine-treated patients and abnormal vision, agitation,
              constipation, dizziness, dry mouth, headache, nausea,
              nervousness, rash, somnolence, sweating, and tremor in
              TCA-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Data from this large series of
              clinical trials confirm that fluoxetine is well tolerated in the
              acute treatment of MDD in adults, especially at a dosage of 20
              mg/d, and is better tolerated than the recommended doses of TCAs.",

              Cosmetic Act in 1938 and escalating with the 1962 Kefauver-Harris
              amendments, increasing pressure has been placed on pharmaceutical
              manufacturers to demonstrate that a drug's benefits outweigh its
              risks. Nowhere has the question of risk versus benefit come under
              greater scrutiny than with anorectics. After the approval in the
              1940s and 1950s of a number of amphetamine and amphetamine-like
              compounds for the treatment of obesity, the U.S. Food and Drug
              Administration struggled to define the efficacy and safety of
              these agents. Labeling restrictions on duration of use and
              warnings about abuse and addiction ultimately contributed to the
              reduced use of anorectics. That trend continued until the
              mid-1990s, when the off-label use of fenfluramine plus
              phentermine (fen-phen) and the approval of dexfenfluramine gave
              rise to widespread, long-term use of anorectics to treat obesity.
              The adverse effects that came to be associated with fenfluramine
              and dexfenfluramine, leading to their eventual withdrawal from
              the market, gave pause to regulators, physicians, patients, and
              drug companies alike. Sibutramine, the latest anorectic to enter
              the market, is now the focus of a landmark trial that is

  abstract = "A variety of recent research has suggested that the feeding
              associated with enhanced neuropeptide Y (NPY) activity within the
              hypothalamus may operate in part by interacting antagonistically
              with other neural processes responsive to serotonin
              (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT). To test this possibility further,
              experiments were performed to determine if the magnitude of
              feeding produced by injecting NPY into the paraventricular
              nucleus (PVN) or the perifornical hypothalamus (PFH) was
              diminished by coinjections of 5-HT into these two sites or
              peripheral injections of the 5-HT agonist, d-fenfluramine. Adult
              male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted unilaterally with
              stainless steel cannulae aimed to terminate either in the PVN or
              the PFH. In both studies, NPY (235 pmol) produced significant
              feeding in both sites either 1 or 2 h after injection when
              compared to saline. This enhanced feeding response was
              significantly greater in the PFH 2 h after injection (40\% in the
              central study; 70\% in the peripheral study). Coinjection of 5-HT
              (6.3, 12.5, or 25.0 nmol) into either site had no effect on the
              induction of this NPY-induced feeding response. However,
              peripherally injected d-fenfluramine (0.32, 0.63, or 1.25 mg/kg)
              produced strong dose-dependent attenuation both 1- and 2-h food
              intake elicited by 235 pmol NPY in either site, with the PFH
              being proportionately more sensitive to this effect. Viewed
              together, these results suggest that the feeding-suppressant
              effects of systemic fenfluramine on hypothalamic NPY-induced
              feeding may operate largely via peripheral mechanisms and/or
              central ones that have little to do with its 5-HT agonistic
              effects within the PVN or PFH.",

              serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) plays an important part in
              within-meal satiation and post-meal satiety processes. Thus, the
              serotonin system has provided a viable target for weight control,
              critical to the action of at least two effective anti-obesity
              treatments, both producing clinically significant weight loss
              over a year or more. Numerous serotonin receptor subtypes have
              been identified; of these, serotonin 5-HT1B and 5-HT2C receptors
              have been specifically recognised as mediators of
              serotonin-induced satiety.A number of serotonergic drugs,
              including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs),
              dexfenfluramine and 5-HT2C receptor agonists, have been shown to
              significantly attenuate rodent bodyweight gain. This effect is
              strongly associated with marked hypophagia and is probably
              mediated by the hypothalamic melanocortin system. Additionally,
              sibutramine, dexfenfluramine, fluoxetine and the 5-HT2C receptor
              agonist chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) have all been shown to
              modify appetite in both lean and obese humans, resulting in
              reduced caloric intake. Clinical studies demonstrate serotonergic
              drugs specifically reduce appetite prior to and following the
              consumption of fixed caloric loads, and cause a reduction in
              pre-meal appetite and caloric intake at ad libitum meals. Weight
              loss in the obese has also been produced by treatment with both
              the serotonin precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan and the preferential
              5-HT2C receptor agonist mCPP.A new generation of 5-HT2C receptor
              selective agonists have been developed and at least one,
              lorcaserin (APD356), is currently undergoing clinical trials. In
              addition, 5-HT6 receptor antagonists such as PRX-07034 and
              BVT74316 have been shown to potently reduce food intake and
              bodyweight gain in rodent models and have recently entered
              clinical trials. However, the role of the 5-HT6 receptor in the
              expression of appetite remains to be determined. The hope is that
              these drugs will not only be free of their predecessors' adverse
              effect profiles, but will also be equally or more effective at
              regulating appetite and controlling bodyweight.",

              neurobiological underpinnings of impulsive aggression and to help
              account for its connections with these other disorders, this
              paper reviews relevant biochemical, brain imaging, and genetic
              studies. The review suggests that dysfunctional interactions
              between serotonin and dopamine systems in the prefrontal cortex
              may be an important mechanism underlying the link between
              impulsive aggression and its comorbid disorders. Specifically,
              serotonin hypofunction may represent a biochemical trait that
              predisposes individuals to impulsive aggression, with dopamine
              hyperfunction contributing in an additive fashion to the

              notoriously difficult. Traditional drug development fails to
              exploit knowledge of the psychological factors that crucially
              influence appetite, concentrating instead on restrictive criteria
              of intake and weight reduction, allied to a mechanistic view of
              energy regulation. Drugs are under development that may produce
              beneficial changes in appetite expression in the obese. These
              currently include glucagon-like peptide-1 analogs such as
              liraglutide, an amylin analog davalintide, the 5-HT(2C) receptor

              Intuitively, these processes should be effective targets for

  abstract = "The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have emerged
              as a major therapeutic advance in psychopharmacology. As a
              result, the discovery of these agents marks a milestone in
              neuropsychopharmacology and rational drug design, and has
              launched a new era in psychotropic drug development. Prior to the
              SSRIs, all psychotropic medications were the result of chance
              observation. In an attempt to develop a SSRI, researchers
              discovered a number of nontricyclic agents with amine-uptake
              inhibitory properties, acting on both noradrenergic and
              serotonergic neurons with considerable differences in potency. A
              given drug may affect one or more sites over its clinically
              relevant dosing range and may produce multiple and different
              clinical effects. The enhanced safety profile includes a reduced
              likelihood of pharmacodynamically mediated adverse drug-drug
              interactions by avoiding affects on sites that are not essential
              to the intended outcome. SSRIs were developed for inhibition of
              the neuronal uptake pump for serotonin (5-HT), a property shared
              with the TCAs, but without affecting the other various
              neuroreceptors or fast sodium channels. The therapeutic mechanism
              of action of SSRIs involves alteration in the 5-HT system. The
              plethora of biological substrates, receptors and pathways for
              5-HT are candidates to mediate not only the therapeutic actions
              of SSRIs, but also their side effects. A hypothesis to explain
              these immediate side effects is that 5-HT is increased at
              specific 5-HT receptor subtypes in discrete regions of the body
              where the relevant physiologic processes are regulated. Marked
              differences exist between the SSRIs with regard to effects on
              specific cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, and thus the likelihood
              of clinically important pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions.
              Although no clear relationship exists between the clinical
              efficacy, plasma concentration of SSRIs, nor any threshold that
              defines toxic concentrations, but therapeutic drug monitoring
              (TDM) may be useful in special populations, such as in elderly
              patients, poor metabolizers (PM) of sparteine (CYP2D6) or
              mephenytoin (CYP2C19), and patients with liver and kidney
              impairment. Several meta-analyses have reviewed the comparative
              efficacy of TCAs and SSRIs, and concluded that both TCAs and
              SSRIs have similar efficacy in the treatment of depression. SSRIs
              have demonstrated better efficacy and tolerability in the
              treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). They have also
              been found to be effective in the treatment for social anxiety
              disorder both in reducing total levels of social anxiety and in
              improving overall clinical condition. The benefit of SSRIs in
              anorexia nervosa (AN) is apparently short-term unless medication
              is given in the context of nutritional or behavioral therapy. No
              single antidepressant can ever be recommended for every patient,
              but in a vast majority of patients, SSRIs should be considered as
              one of the first-line drugs in the treatment of depression.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: This prospective study tested the diathesis-stress
              and causal mediation components of Beck's (1967, 1983) cognitive
              theory of depression. DESIGN: In order to allow for a stringent
              test of the aetiological component of Beck's theory, we used a
              short-term longitudinal design in which participants'
              dysfunctional attitudes were assessed prior to the occurrence of
              a negative event. METHODS: In all, 136 high school seniors
              applying to the University of Pennsylvania completed measures of
              depressed mood and dysfunctional attitudes 1-8 weeks before
              receiving their admissions decision (Time 1). The assessment of
              dysfunctional attitudes was preceded by a priming task designed
              to activate latent depressogenic schemata. Participants also
              completed measures of depressed mood, negative views of the self,
              and negative views of the future shortly after they received
              their admissions decision (Time 2) and four days later (Time 3).
              RESULTS: Consistent with the diathesis-stress component of Beck's
              theory, dysfunctional attitudes predicted increases in depressed
              mood immediately following a negative admissions outcome (Time
              2). In addition, consistent with the causal mediation component
              of the theory, in negative outcome students, the relationship
              between dysfunctional attitudes and increases in depressed mood
              was mediated by negative views of the future. Contrary to
              predictions, however, this relationship was not mediated by
              negative views of the self. In addition, contrary to predictions,
              dysfunctional attitudes did not predict enduring depressed mood
              after a negative outcome (Time 3). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with
              dysfunctional attitudes are likely to show increases in depressed
              mood following the occurrence of negative events. The
              relationship between dysfunctional attitudes and increases in
              depressed mood following the occurrence of negative events is
              mediated by negative views of the future.",

               physical activity, and frequency of orthorexia nervosa between
               university students enrolled in an exercise science program (n =
               118) or a business program (n = 89). The students completed the

               degree of self-reporting of pain and orthorexia nervosa in
               exercise science students may cause problems in the future,
               since they are expected to coach others in healthy living. Our

              challenging to address; however, the primary care setting
              provides an important opportunity for critical medical and
              psychosocial intervention. The recently published Diagnostic and
              Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed., includes updated
              diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa (e.g., elimination of
              amenorrhea as a diagnostic criterion) and for bulimia nervosa
              (e.g., criterion for frequency of binge episodes decreased to an
              average of once per week). In addition to the role of
              environmental triggers and societal expectations of body size and
              shape, research has suggested that genes and discrete biochemical
              signals contribute to the development of eating disorders.
              Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa occur most often in
              adolescent females and are often accompanied by depression and
              other comorbid psychiatric disorders. For low-weight patients

              affected, ranging from hypotension and osteopenia to
              life-threatening arrhythmias, often requiring emergent assessment
              and hospitalization for metabolic stabilization. In patients with
              frequent purging or laxative abuse, the presence of electrolyte

              days) and acutely after a single injection (10 mg/kg). Fluoxetine
              also significantly reduced neuropeptide Y levels in the
              paraventricular nucleus, a major site of neuropeptide Y release
              which is highly sensitive to the appetite-stimulating actions of
              neuropeptide Y. Push-pull sampling in lean and fatty Zucker rats
              showed that neuropeptide Y secretion in the paraventricular
              nucleus was significantly reduced after acute fluoxetine
              treatment. Furthermore, seven days fluoxetine treatment prevented
              the significant increases in hypothalamic neuropeptide Y
              messenger RNA which were induced in lean rats by food restriction
              which precisely matched the hypophagia induced by the drug. We
              conclude that fluoxetine inhibits various aspects of the activity
              of the neuropeptide Yergic arcuato-paraventricular neurons, and
              suggest that reduced neuropeptide Y release in the
              paraventricular nucleus may mediate, at least in part, the drug's
              hypophagic action. We further suggest that serotonin may
              influence food intake and energy balance by inhibiting the
              arcuato-paraventricular projection, and that the two
              neurotransmitters may act together to regulate feeding and energy
              homoeostasis.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to study the potential
              involvement of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and orexins in the
              anorexigenic mechanism of fluoxetine in obese Zucker rats,
              assessing the effects of chronic fluoxetine treatment on NPY and
              orexin immunostaining in several hypothalamic regions. RESEARCH
              METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Male obese Zucker (fa/fa) rats were
              administered fluoxetine (10 mg/kg intraperitoneally) daily for 2
              weeks. The control group was administered 0.9\% NaCl solution.
              Carcass composition was assessed using the official methods of
              the Association of Official Analytical Chemists. To test the
              potential thermogenic effect of fluoxetine administration, total
              body oxygen consumption was measured daily for 60 minutes before
              fluoxetine or saline injection and for 30 minutes after drug or
              saline injection. Hypothalamic arcuate and paraventricular
              nuclei, and the lateral hypothalamic area were immunostained for
              NPY, orexin A, and orexin B. Commercial kits were used for serum
              determinations. RESULTS: Chronic fluoxetine administration in
              obese Zucker rats generated a reduction in body weight gain, food
              intake, adipocyte size, fat mass, and body protein. A decrease in
              NPY immunostaining in the paraventricular nucleus, without
              changes in the arcuate, was observed. However, no changes were
              observed in the number of neural cells immunostained for orexin A
              or orexin B in the lateral hypothalamic area. DISCUSSION: Due to
              the hyperphagic effect of NPY in the paraventricular nucleus,
              these results suggest that NPY, but not orexins, could be
              involved in the anorexigenic effect of fluoxetine in obese Zucker

              fluoxetine (40 mg) or placebo at 0930 daily. Food intake,
              performance and subjective ratings were measured throughout the
              day. The interaction between fluoxetine and carbohydrate
              consumption was examined by providing subjects diets that
              engendered varied levels of carbohydrate intake. When subjects
              received placebo and had access to a regular diet, they consumed
              3400 kcal day-1 (53\% carbohydrate, 34\% fat, 13\% protein); and
              fluoxetine decreased caloric intake to 2770 Kcal, without
              affecting macronutrient contribution. Caloric intake (2730 Kcal;
              67\% carbohydrate) under the high-carbohydrate condition when
              subjects received fluoxetine was not different from intake under
              the regular-diet fluoxetine conditions. Subjects reported that
              the high-fat (low-carbohydrate) diet was less palatable and

              fluoxetine decreased caloric intake by an additional 400 Kcal

              is only a fine line between purely functional behaviour and
              clinically relevant eating disorders. Especially the rapid form
              of weight manipulation seems to foster later eating disorders. So
              far, most studies have focussed on adult athletes and
              concentrated on manifest eating disorders. In contrast, our
              review concentrates on young athletes and weight-control
              behaviour as a risk factor for eating disorders. An electronic
              search according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for
              Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) Statement was performed

              weight-concerns, each of them combined with elite athlete, young

              Overall, data are inconsistent. In general, athletes do not seem

              weight-control behaviour. It does seem to be more prevalent in
              leanness sports, though. There is evidence for pathogenic
              weight-control behaviour in both genders; male athletes mostly
              trying to gain weight whereas females emphasise weight reduction.
              There is not enough data to make predictions about connections
              with age of onset. Young elite athletes do show weight-control
              behaviour with varying degrees of frequency and severity. In
              particular, leanness sports seem to be a risk factor for weight

              eating disorders met criteria outlined in the 4th edition of the
              Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).
              METHOD: Six hundred sixty-eight patients recruited for the
              Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study (CLPS)
              were reliably assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for
              DSM-IV Axis I Disorders and the Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV
              Personality Disorders. The distribution of ED diagnoses was
              compared among four PD study groups (schizotypal, borderline,
              avoidant, obsessive-compulsive) and a fifth study group with MDD

               nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and orthorexia nervosa are seen within
               the athlete population. The majority of athletes are considered

               adults and has previously been shown to have negative effects on
               body image, depression, social comparison, and disordered
               eating. One eating disorder of interest in this context is
               orthorexia nervosa, an obsession with eating healthily. High
               orthorexia nervosa prevalence has been found in populations who
               take an active interest in their health and body and is
               frequently comorbid with anorexia nervosa. Here, we investigate
               links between social media use, in particularly Instagram and
               orthorexia nervosa symptoms. METHODS: We conducted an online
               survey of social media users (N = 680) following health food
               accounts. We assessed their social media use, eating behaviours,
               and orthorexia nervosa symptoms using the ORTO-15 inventory.
               RESULTS: Higher Instagram use was associated with a greater
               tendency towards orthorexia nervosa, with no other social media
               channel having this effect. In exploratory analyses Twitter
               showed a small positive association with orthorexia symptoms.
               BMI and age had no association with orthorexia nervosa. The
               prevalence of orthorexia nervosa among the study population was
               49\%, which is significantly higher than the general population
               (<1\%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the healthy eating
               community on Instagram has a high prevalence of orthorexia
               symptoms, with higher Instagram use being linked to increased
               symptoms. These findings highlight the implications social media
               can have on psychological wellbeing, and the influence social
               media 'celebrities' may have over hundreds of thousands of
               individuals. These results may also have clinical implications

               users). The coding of \#orthorexia images is pending but will
               help us further understand the orthorexia online community.
               Conclusions: As the network analysis and text analysis suggested
               an eating disorder recovery theme, this suggests that Instagram
               may be being used as a supportive and interactive community for
               those who have/had symptoms of orthorexia.",

               the ways in which social trends outside schools relating to ?the

              Our paper notes the important contribution of school educators
              whilst warning of the current need to specifically examine how
              teachers and school personnel may be best trained and prepared
              for such a preventive role, whether they currently feel willing
              and able to undertake such a role, and whether some groups of
              teachers may be personally susceptible to body image and eating
              problems. It is vital to understand the knowledge, behaviors,
              attitudes, and expectations of educators implementing prevention
              programs in order to ensure that they are personally and
              professionally capable of carrying out prevention initiatives in

               conditions in schools which render them contexts replete with
               social messages about the body, health, and self. Research has
               suggested that both the formal and informal contexts of

              associated with adverse health consequences, including increased
              risk for body dissatisfaction and disordered eating behaviors,
              which are risk factors for eating disorders. Although concerns
              about these problems have stimulated calls for broader
              intervention efforts in schools, actions thus far have been
              limited. This study examined educators' perspectives about
              potential policy actions to address these issues in schools.
              METHODS: Educators (N = 240) completed an online questionnaire
              assessing their support for 11 potential school-based policy
              actions to address weight-related bullying and eating disorders.
              Participants also rated policies according to their feasibility
              and potential for positive impact. RESULTS: Forty-eight percent
              of participants observed weight-related bullying in their school
              and 99\% expressed the importance of intervening in such
              incidents. A large majority (75\%-94\%) supported 8 of the 11
              policies, especially actions requiring school-based health
              curriculum to include content on eating disorder prevention
              (94\%), and addressing weight-bullying through antibullying
              policies (92\%), staff training (89\%), and school curriculum

              Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ). Individuals score in the range
              0-50. Four groups of subjects were assessed: Group 1: 58 adults

              Group 2: 174 randomly selected controls. Group 3: 840 students in
              Cambridge University; and Group 4: 16 winners of the UK
              Mathematics Olympiad. The adults with AS/HFA had a mean AQ score
              of 35.8 (SD = 6.5), significantly higher than Group 2 controls (M
              = 16.4, SD = 6.3). 80\% of the adults with AS/HFA scored 32+,
              versus 2\% of controls. Among the controls, men scored slightly
              but significantly higher than women. No women scored extremely
              highly (AQ score 34+) whereas 4\% of men did so. Twice as many
              men (40\%) as women (21\%) scored at intermediate levels (AQ
              score 20+). Among the AS/HFA group, male and female scores did
              not differ significantly. The students in Cambridge University
              did not differ from the randomly selected control group, but
              scientists (including mathematicians) scored significantly higher
              than both humanities and social sciences students, confirming an
              earlier study that autistic conditions are associated with
              scientific skills. Within the sciences, mathematicians scored
              highest. This was replicated in Group 4, the Mathematics Olympiad
              winners scoring significantly higher than the male Cambridge
              humanities students. 6\% of the student sample scored 32+ on the
              AQ. On interview, 11 out of 11 of these met three or more DSM-IV
              criteria for AS/HFA, and all were studying sciences/mathematics,
              and 7 of the 11 met threshold on these criteria. Test-retest and
              interrater reliability of the AQ was good. The AQ is thus a

              clinical features between some children with High Intellectual
              Potential (HIP or ``Giftedness'' = Total IQ > 2 SD), and children
              with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) without intellectual or
              language delay, formerly diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome. Some
              of these common features are social interaction impairments,
              special interests, and in some cases high-verbal abilities. The
              aim of this article is to determine whether these similarities
              exist at more fundamental levels, other than clinical, and to
              explore the literature in order to provide empirical support for
              an overlap between ASD and HIP. Method: First, comparative
              studies between ASD and HIP children were sought. Because of a
              lack of data, the respective characteristics of ASD and HIP
              subjects were explored by a cross-sectional review of different
              areas of research. Emphasis was placed on psychometric and
              cognitive evaluations, experimental and developmental
              assessments, and neurobiological research, following a
              ``bottom-up'' procedure. Results: This review highlights the
              existence of similarities in the neurocognitive, developmental
              and neurobiological domains between these profiles, which require
              further study. In addition, the conclusions of several studies
              show that there are differences between HIP children with a
              homogeneous Intellectual Quotient profile and children with a
              heterogeneous Intellectual Quotient profile. Conclusion: HIP
              seems to cover different developmental profiles, one of which
              might share features with ASD. A new line of investigation
              providing a possible starting-point for future research is

              ASD children. We previously demonstrated that children with

              microstructure, and that this white matter microstructural
              pathology correlates with atypical sensory behavior. In this

              to evaluate the structural connectivity of specific white matter
              tracts in boys with ASD (n = 15) and boys with SPD (n = 16),
              relative to typically developing children (n = 23). We define

              fractional anisotropy. Both the SPD and ASD cohorts demonstrate

               Autism affects more male than female individuals, and

               Individuals with autism have atypical cognitive profiles, such
               as impaired social cognition and social perception, executive
               dysfunction, and atypical perceptual and information processing.
               These profiles are underpinned by atypical neural development at
               the systems level. Genetics has a key role in the aetiology of
               autism, in conjunction with developmentally early environmental
               factors. Large-effect rare mutations and small-effect common

               explored how Swedish high school students perceive and negotiate
               the trend regarding exercise, diet and body ideals.
               Semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten high school
               students, aged 16?18 years, from various educational programs
               and with varying levels of physical activity. Using qualitative
               content analysis, we developd one overarching theme navigating
               life satisfaction in the face of an ?unhealthy fitness hype?.
               Four additional, interrelated categories showed how the young
               people negotiated this developing trend through: (1) the quest
               for social recognition and value, (2) social media sets the
               standards, (3) the paradox of strong and skinny as the new
               standard, and (4) the need for new safety nets. Our results
               highlight the young people?s perceptions of an excessive and
               influential focus on health and exercise in contemporary
               society. They described a fitness hype as exorbitant and
               unhealthy ideals of body and exercise, and understood this as
               problematic. Social media was seen as contributing to this hype
               as a powerful arena for ?the quest for social recognition and
               value?. While not all the young people felt negatively affected

              behaviours. The aim of the present study was to illuminate PTs'
              understandings of healthy and unhealthy exercise and eating
              behaviours in relation to orthorexia nervosa in a fitness gym
              context. Five focus groups with 14 PTs were conducted. These were
              analysed using interpretative qualitative content analysis and
              Becker's model ``Kinds of Deviance.'' In contrast to PTs' health
              norms (practicing balanced behaviours and contributing to
              well-being), ON was expressed mainly in terms of exercise
              behaviour and as being excessive and in total control. The PTs
              maintain that extreme behaviours are legitimized by an aggressive
              exercise trend in society and that they fear to falsely accuse
              clients of being pathological. Certain sport contexts
              (bodybuilding, fitness competitions and elite sports) and
              specific groups (fitness professionals) contribute to
              complicating PTs' negotiations due to a competition, performance
              and/or profession norm, making it difficult to determine whether
              or not to intervene.",

  abstract = "Reliability and stability have been treated as the major
              requirements for the Business Support System (BSS) in
              telecommunications networks. It is crucial and essential for
              service providers to maintain good operating state of the BSS. In
              this paper, we aim at system error prediction for a BSS, i.e., we
              predict occurrences of the abnormal state or behavior of the BSS.
              Because the occurrences of system errors are rare events in the
              BSS (i.e., the dataset of system status is highly imbalanced), it
              is highly challenging to use machine learning or deep learning
              algorithms to predict system error for the BSS. To address this
              challenge, we propose a machine learning based framework for the
              system error prediction and a Frequency-based Feature Creation
              (FFC) algorithm to create new features to improve prediction. By
              adding the time-series information created by the existing
              features, the proposed FFC can amplify the effects of important
              features. Our experimental results show that the FFC
              significantly improves the prediction performance for the Random

              non-pharmaceutical interventions have suppressed the local
              outbreak of this disease1. Here we use a modelling approach to
              reconstruct the full-spectrum dynamics of COVID-19 in Wuhan
              between 1 January and 8 March 2020 across 5 periods defined by
              events and interventions, on the basis of 32,583
              laboratory-confirmed cases1. Accounting for presymptomatic
              infectiousness2, time-varying ascertainment rates, transmission
              rates and population movements3, we identify two key features of
              the outbreak: high covertness and high transmissibility. We
              estimate 87\% (lower bound, 53\%) of the infections before 8
              March 2020 were unascertained (potentially including asymptomatic
              and mildly symptomatic individuals); and a basic reproduction
              number (R0) of 3.54 (95\% credible interval 3.40-3.67) in the
              early outbreak, much higher than that of severe acute respiratory
              syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)4,5.
              We observe that multipronged interventions had considerable
              positive effects on controlling the outbreak, decreasing the
              reproduction number to 0.28 (95\% credible interval 0.23-0.33)
              and-by projection-reducing the total infections in Wuhan by
              96.0\% as of 8 March 2020. We also explore the probability of
              resurgence following the lifting of all interventions after 14
              consecutive days of no ascertained infections; we estimate this
              probability at 0.32 and 0.06 on the basis of models with 87\% and
              53\% unascertained cases, respectively-highlighting the risk
              posed by substantial covert infections under changing control
              measures. These results have important implications when
              considering strategies of continuing surveillance and
              interventions to eventually contain outbreaks of COVID-19.",

               effector of biological tasks. The latter function is enabled by
               RNA's ability to adopt complex secondary and tertiary folds and
               thus has motivated extensive computational and experimental
               efforts for determining RNA structures. Existing approaches for
               evaluating RNA structure have been largely limited to in vitro
               systems, yet the thermodynamic forces which drive RNA folding in
               vitro may not be sufficient to predict stable RNA structures in
               vivo. Indeed, the presence of RNA-binding proteins and
               ATP-dependent helicases can influence which structures are
               present inside cells. Here we present an approach for globally
               monitoring RNA structure in native conditions in vivo with
               single-nucleotide precision. This method is based on in vivo
               modification with dimethyl sulphate (DMS), which reacts with
               unpaired adenine and cytosine residues, followed by deep
               sequencing to monitor modifications. Our data from yeast and
               mammalian cells are in excellent agreement with known messenger
               RNA structures and with the high-resolution crystal structure of
               the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosome. Comparison between in
               vivo and in vitro data reveals that in rapidly dividing cells
               there are vastly fewer structured mRNA regions in vivo than in
               vitro. Even thermostable RNA structures are often denatured in
               cells, highlighting the importance of cellular processes in
               regulating RNA structure. Indeed, analysis of mRNA structure
               under ATP-depleted conditions in yeast shows that
               energy-dependent processes strongly contribute to the
               predominantly unfolded state of mRNAs inside cells. Our studies
               broadly enable the functional analysis of physiological RNA
               structures and reveal that, in contrast to the Anfinsen view of
               protein folding whereby the structure formed is the most
               thermodynamically favourable, thermodynamics have an incomplete
               role in determining mRNA structure in vivo.",

              plasticity (STDP) rule. In our approach, sub-networks compete via
              inhibitory interactions to learn features from different
              locations of the input space. These locally-connected SNNs
              (LC-SNNs) manifest key topological features of the spatial
              interaction of biological neurons. We explore a biologically
              inspired n-gram classification approach allowing parallel

              barriers to clinical and academic productivity, research success,
              and work-life balance. We sought to determine if the Eastern
              Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) Mentoring Program
              has met its goals of fostering academic and personal growth in
              young acute care surgeons. METHODS: We conducted a systematic
              program evaluation of EAST Mentoring Program's first 4 years.
              Demographic information was collected from EAST records,
              mentorship program applications, and mentee-mentor career
              development plans. We reviewed the career development plans for
              thematic commonalities and results of a structured, online
              questionnaire distributed since program inception. A mixed
              methods approach was used to better understand the program goals
              from both mentee and mentor perspectives, as well as attitudes
              and barriers regarding the perceived success of this career
              development program. RESULTS: During 2012 to 2015, 65 mentoring
              dyads were paired and 60 completed the program. Of 184 surveys
              distributed, 108 were returned (57\% response rate). Respondents
              were evenly distributed between mentees and mentors (53 vs. 55, p
              = 0.768). In participant surveys, mentoring relationships were
              viewed to focus on research (45\%), ``sticky situations'' (e.g.,
              communication, work-life balance) (27\%), education (18\%), or
              administrative issues (10\%). Mentees were more focused on
              research and education versus mentors (74\% vs. 50\%; p = 0.040).
              Mentees felt that goals were ``always'' or ``usually'' met versus
              mentors (89\% vs. 77\%; p = 0.096). Two barriers to successful
              mentorship included time and communication, with most pairs
              communicating by email. Most respondents (91\%) planned to
              continue the relationship beyond the EAST Mentoring Program and
              recommended the experience to colleagues. CONCLUSION: Mentee
              satisfaction with the EAST Mentoring Program was high. Mentoring
              is a beneficial tool to promote success among EAST's young
              members, but differences exist between mentee and mentor
              perceptions. Revising communication expectations and time
              commitment to improve career development may help our young acute
              care surgeons.",

              social consequences of ``clean dieting'' and orthorexia nervosa.
              In two studies, we examined the social stigma of clean dieting
              and orthorexia. METHOD: In Study 1, participants read a vignette
              describing a woman following a ``clean'' diet, a woman with
              anorexia, or a control target (minimal information about the
              individual). In Study 2, participants read a vignette describing
              a woman with orthorexia, a woman displaying identical orthorexic
              behaviors but without the orthorexia label, a woman with
              anorexia, or a control target. Participants then rated the target
              individual on a range of measures assessing stereotypes,
              emotions, and behavioral intentions toward the target. RESULTS:
              Study 1 found that the clean-dieting target was evaluated more
              negatively than the control target on some dimensions, but less
              negatively than the target with anorexia nervosa. Study 2 found
              that evaluations of the targets with orthorexia nervosa were more
              negative than evaluations of a control target, but did not differ
              from evaluations of the target with anorexia nervosa. Perceptions
              of the target's control over her behavior were associated with
              more positive evaluations (Studies 1 and 2), whereas perceptions
              of blame and responsibility for the condition were associated
              with more negative evaluations (Study 2). CONCLUSIONS: Overall,
              these findings highlight the potential negative social
              consequences of clean dieting and orthorexia nervosa, and point

              measured during the postingestive period. Because the BSS is
              considered to reflect the operations of natural physiological
              processes underlying satiety, the sequence can be used to
              discriminate between different drugs (and other manipulations)
              that reduce food intake via these natural physiological
              mechanisms or those that do so by interference. The BSS is only
              produced by the presence of a caloric load in the gut, and the
              preabsorptive satiety factors (such as CCK) the caloric load
              triggers. The BSS is most accurately defined by continuous
              observation rather than time or event sampling techniques
              [Partial Time Sampling (PTS) or Momentary Time Sampling (MTS)].
              Continuous observation also allows the true duration and true
              frequency of each behavior to be analyzed. Continuous observation
              can be used to determine if the profiles associated with the
              reduction in food intake is caused by nausea, sedation,
              hyperactivity, or altered palatability of food. At the present
              time is it possible to identify a number of drugs whose
              suppression of food intake is associated with the disruption or
              preservation of the BSS. Drugs that increase synaptic 5-HT
              activity such d-fenfluramine, fluoxetine. and sibutramine all

              similar effects. However, the 5-HT2 agonist DOI and the 5-HT1a/1b
              agonist RU-24969 disrupt the BSS by inducing hyperactivity as
              does amphetamine. The 5-HT2 agonist MK-212 disrupts the BSS by
              inducing sedation. Selective dopamine agonists, at low doses,
              such as SKF-38393 (DA1) and LY-171555 (DA2) also preserve the
              BSS. However, detailed behavioral analysis of the effects of many

               of ``good'' or ``bad'' nutrients. Investigating the butter
               versus margarine debate, the battle between low-fat, low-carb,
               and other weight-loss diets, and the food industry's strategic
               promotion of nutritionally enhanced foods, Scrinis reveals the
               scientific, social, and economic factors driving our modern
               fascination with nutrition.Scrinis develops an original
               framework and terminology for analyzing the characteristics and
               consequences of nutritionism since the late nineteenth century.
               He begins with the era of quantification, in which the idea of
               protective nutrients, caloric reductionism, and vitamins'
               curative effects took shape. He follows with the era of good and
               bad nutritionism, which set nutricentric dietary guidelines and
               defined the parameters of unhealthy nutrients; and concludes
               with our current era of functional nutritionism, in which the
               focus has shifted to targeted nutrients, superfoods, and optimal
               diets. Scrinis's research underscores the critical role of
               nutrition science and dietary advice in shaping our relationship
               to food and our bodies and in heightening our nutritional
               anxieties. He ultimately shows how nutritionism has aligned the
               demands and perceived needs of consumers with the commercial
               interests of food manufacturers and corporations. Scrinis also
               offers an alternative paradigm for assessing the healthfulness
               of foods -- the food quality paradigm -- that privileges food
               production and processing quality, cultural-traditional
               knowledge, and sensual-practical experience, and promotes less
               reductive forms of nutrition research and dietary advice.",

  abstract = "Eating disorders are life-threatening conditions that are
              challenging to address; however, the primary care setting
              provides an important opportunity for critical medical and
              psychosocial intervention. The recently published Diagnostic and
              Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed., includes updated
              diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa (e.g., elimination of
              amenorrhea as a diagnostic criterion) and for bulimia nervosa
              (e.g., criterion for frequency of binge episodes decreased to an
              average of once per week). In addition to the role of
              environmental triggers and societal expectations of body size and
              shape, research has suggested that genes and discrete biochemical
              signals contribute to the development of eating disorders.
              Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa occur most often in
              adolescent females and are often accompanied by depression and
              other comorbid psychiatric disorders. For low-weight patients
              with anorexia nervosa, virtually all physiologic systems are
              affected, ranging from hypotension and osteopenia to
              life-threatening arrhythmias, often requiring emergent assessment
              and hospitalization for metabolic stabilization. In patients with
              frequent purging or laxative abuse, the presence of electrolyte
              abnormalities requires prompt intervention. Family-based
              treatment is helpful for adolescents with anorexia nervosa,
              whereas short-term psychotherapy, such as cognitive behavior
              therapy, is effective for most patients with bulimia nervosa. The
              use of psychotropic medications is limited for anorexia nervosa,
              whereas treatment studies have shown a benefit of antidepressant
              medications for patients with bulimia nervosa. Treatment is most
              effective when it includes a multidisciplinary, teambased
              approach.",

  abstract = "Adult, regularly cycling female Fischer rats were injected daily
              with 10 mg/kg fluoxetine for 12-23 days. In the first experiment,
              body weight and vaginal smears were monitored daily. Fluoxetine
              treatment reduced body weight within the first 24 h of treatment.
              Fluoxetine treatment also elongated the estrous cycle, reduced
              blood levels of progesterone, and eliminated lordosis behavior.
              In the second experiment, body weight and food intake were
              examined and a pair-fed group was included to determine if
              fluoxetine-induced anorexia contributed to the disturbance of the
              estrous cycle. In pair-fed rats, effects similar to fluoxetine
              treatment were present. These results lead to the suggestion that
              fluoxetine's anorectic properties could disrupt the female's
              normal endocrine cyclicity and that this disruption could be
              relevant to the reduction in sexual behavior and motivation.
              However, when the duration of fluoxetine treatment was extended
              beyond 16 to 17 days, fluoxetine-treated female rats reinitiated
              vaginal cyclicity and showed evidence of normal sexual
              receptivity. In contrast, the estrous cycles of their pair-fed
              counterparts remained disrupted. Thus, restricted food intake
              appears to contribute to the disruption of the estrous cycle and
              elimination of sexual receptivity during fluoxetine treatment.
              However, compensatory changes in the serotonergic system that are
              associated with chronic fluoxetine administration may contribute
              to the gradual recovery of estrous cyclicity and sexual
              receptivity of the fluoxetine-treated animals.",

              any differences between genders and among different age-groups.
              The research instrument was an Eating Habits Questionnaire (EHQ)
              which consisted of 35 items. There were 382 respondents involved
              in the study. The reliability and factor structure of the
              questionnaire were verified by using factor analysis. The results
              of MANOVA showed that there is a significant difference in the
              habits concerning healthy eating between men and women [F
              (3,378)=4.26, p=0.006; Wilks' Lambda=0.97]. When the results for
              the dependent variables (knowledge, problems, and feelings) were
              considered separately, it was determined that there is no
              significant difference between men and women, which confirms the
              results of the t-test. The effect of age on the three dimensions
              of healthy eating habits was examined within three age-groups, by
              using ANOVA. The results showed that knowledge about healthy
              eating increases with age [F (2,379)=6.14, p=0.002] as well as
              positive feelings which occur as a result of healthy eating [F

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: In eating disorders (EDs), treatment outcome
              measurement has traditionally focused on symptom reduction rather
              than functioning or quality of life (QoL). The Eating Disorders
              Quality of Life Scale (EDQLS) was recently developed to allow for
              measurement of broader outcomes. We examined responsiveness of
              the EDQLS in a longitudinal multi-site study. METHODS: The EDQLS
              and comparator generic QoL scales were collected in person at
              baseline, and 3 and 6 months from 130 participants (mean age 25.6
              years; range 14-60) in 12 treatment programs in four Canadian
              provinces. Total score differences across the time points and
              responsiveness were examined using both anchor- and
              distribution-based methods. RESULTS: 98 (75\%) and 85 (65\%)
              responses were received at 3 and 6 months respectively. No
              statistically significant differences were found between the
              baseline sample and those lost to follow-up on any measured
              characteristic. Mean EDQLS total scores increased from 110 (SD =
              24) to 124.5 (SD = 29) at 3 months and 129 (SD = 28) at 6 months,
              and the difference by time was tested using a general linear
              model (GLM) to account for repeated measurement (p < .001).
              Responsiveness was good overall (Cohen's d = .61 and .80), and
              confirmed using anchor methods across 5 levels of self-reported
              improvement in health status (p < .001). Effect sizes across time
              were moderate or large for for all age groups. Internal
              consistency (Chronbach's alpha=.96) held across measurement
              points and patterns of responsiveness held across subscales.
              EDQLS responsiveness exceeded that of the Quality of Life
              Inventory, the Short Form-12 (mental and physical subscales) and
              was similar to the 16-dimension quality of life scale.
              CONCLUSIONS: The EDQLS is responsive to change in geographically
              diverse and clinically heterogeneous programs over a relatively
              short time period in adolescents and adults. It shows promise as
              an outcome measure for both research and clinical practice.",
