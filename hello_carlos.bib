              this regard, as is also required in this law. At that time, the
              district will revise its Bill of Rights, if necessary, to be in
              compliance with said regulation. Pursuant to New York State
              Education Law 2-d, Parents, Legal Guardians and persons in
              parental relation to a student are entitled to certain rights
              with regard to their child's personally identifiable information,

              plain-English summary of such rights. 1. A student's personally
              identifiable information cannot be sold or released for any
              commercial purposes.",
